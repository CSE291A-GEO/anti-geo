They help children improve their motor and social skills. Read this post to know about these and many other indoor and outdoor traditional Indian games.\\n\\nTraditional Indian Indoor Games\\nTraditional Indian indoor games usually require a lot of mental work and improve children\u2019s problem-solving skills. Some of these games have also been adopted by the Western world, and now we know them by their more popular English names.\\n\\n1. Pachisi/Chaupar\\n\\nPachisi or Chaupar is a well-known board game since it was the genesis of the Kurukshetra war in Mahabharata. The Mughals were fond of this game, too. Pachisi was traditionally played on a symmetrical cross cloth. On the other hand, Chaupar was a board game invented in the 4th century.\\n\\nIn both these games, two to four players use cowrie shells and dice to plan their maneuvers and attack opponents. Now, you call this game Ludo, one of the more popular games today. Pachisi or Chaupar is an excellent game to teach your child how to plan and execute.\\n\\n2. Anchankal/Kallankal\\n\\nThis game is widely played in Tamil Nadu. As the name of the game suggests, Anchankal is a game composed of five stones. The game improves hand-eye coordination, concentration, memory, and aiming abilities. This is a very engaging game, and the best part is that you can create your own steps.\\n\\nIn the original game, you use five smooth stones that can be held in your hand. Place the stones on the floor or any flat surface. Pick one stone, toss it in the air, and while that stone is in the air, pick another stone from the ground, while catching the stone tossed in the air before it hits the ground. Repeat this with the rest of the stones.\\n\\nYou can continue this game by picking up different numbers of stones from the floor, or even throwing a different number of stones into the air, and then picking up other stones before other stones fall. It is important that you should not let the stones tossed in the air fall on the ground. It requires some practice, but once you master it, you can enjoy hours of entertainment.\\n\\n3. Ashtapada\\n\\nAshtapada is the predecessor of chess. Just like a chessboard, the Ashtapada board is also divided into an 8\u00d78 square grids but of one color. Ashtapada is a dice game. There are markings on the corners and the center square of the board. These squares are called castles. The pieces on these squares are safe, captured, or removed by the opponents.\\n\\nEach player starts with an even number of pieces to play the game. The pieces must be moved clockwise around the board to enter the castle on the outer edge. Then they enter the castle in the center in a clockwise direction. This is a game to reach the castle.\\n\\nAnother variation of Ashtapada is Dasapada that is played on a 10\u00d710 board.\\n4. Chaturanga\\n\\nChaturanga is an ancient strategy game invented in India. It is believed to be the ancestor of strategy games, such as Chess, Xiangqi, Shogi, and Makruk. Chaturanga is mentioned in many ancient scripts. It is played on the Ashtapada board. There are two players.\\n\\nJust like modern chess, Chaturanga has various pieces \u2014 the King (Raja), General (Mantri or Senapati), Rook (Ratha), Elephant/Bishop (Gaja), Horse/Knight (Ashva), and Pawn (Padaati or Bhata). Each piece moves in a certain direction.\\n\\nThe ultimate goal is to get the opponent\u2019s king into trouble so that he cannot move without being taken by the enemy. Kings and generals played this game to gain new ideas about the form of war offensive.\\n\\n5. Pallankuzhi\\n\\nIt is believed that this ancient game originated in Tamil Nadu but later spread to other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka. This game gained popularity even in Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The game is still played in some rural parts of India and is called Kuzhipara, Ali Guli Mane, or Picchala Peeta in different languages.\\n\\nIn this game, we use a rectangular board that is divided into two rows and seven cups. Players must use 146 counters to put in these cups. These counters are usually cowrie shells or tamarind shells. Each cup contains 12 counters. In the middle row cups, only two counters are placed. There are two players taking turns.\\n\\nThe starting player picks the counters from any of the holes on their side and assigns a counter to each cup in a counterclockwise direction. Once they reach the end of their cups, they move on to their opponent\u2019s cups. When their counters are over, they pick the counters from the next cup and continue the game. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the next cup are captured by the player. The next player takes over.\\n\\nThe game continues until the last counter falls in a cup with two empty cups beyond it. The player can capture no more counters, and their turn is over.\\n\\nIn this intricate game, there are other rules that make it interesting. Although this game is best played between two players, even one person can play the game on a lazy afternoon. Pallankuzhi can be played by both children and adults.\\n\\n6. Antakshari\\n\\nAntakshari is one of the most popular traditional Indian games. The game is played widely in social gatherings and weddings. Children play it in their free time at school. The best thing about this game is that it can also be played in a small space, just like when traveling in a car.\\n\\nAntakshari is the best way to spend time. You need to have a repertoire of songs to play this game. You can play this game in a team. Each team sings in turns, starting from the last letter of the previous song sung by the other team.\\n\\n7. Moksha Patam\\n\\nMoksha Patam or Parama Padam is a board game that is believed to have been invented in ancient India and has spread to other parts of the world. Now, it is commonly called Snakes and Ladders. In ancient India, it was used as a form of entertainment and to teach morality to children.\\n\\nThe basic concept is to teach people that the way to reach heaven or \u201cmoksha\u201d is to abandon the bondage of passion. The ladder symbolizes the rise from one level of enlightenment to another, while the snake symbolizes immoral behavior and how they lead to degeneration. This game is played by two to four players. The first player to reach the \u201chighest heaven\u201d is the winner.\\n\\n8. Aadu puli aatam\\n\\nAadu puli aatam literally means \u201ca game of lambs and tigers.\u201d It is called meka puli aata in Telugu and aadu huli aata in Kannada. This is a two-player game where the tigers hunt goats on an asymmetric grid.\\n\\nIn this game, first, draw a triangle and divide it into three equal parts. Then, draw a rectangle on the entire triangle, intersecting it throughout. Then divide the rectangle horizontally into two parts. One player has 15 \u201cgoats,\u201d and the other player has three \u201ctigers.\u201d Each of these pieces is placed at the intersection point. Tigers try to eat goats, and goats try to actively stop them. The pieces are usually cowrie shells or pebbles.\\n\\n9. Chowkabara\\n\\nThis is another four-player game that is similar to Chaupar or Ludo. The goal of the game is to achieve home safety without getting removed by the opponents\u2019 pieces. The game is popular all over India and is known under different names, such as Eight and Four, Kattam Kalo, Chauka Baara, Changapoo, Ettu Veedu, Kattam Kazhi, and Aada Sada.\\n\\n10.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

The Storybrooke events take place after \\\"The Other Shoe\\\".In the Characters' Past[edit]In Victorian England, Dr. Jekyll is joined by his friend Mary Lydgate, whose father, Dr. Lydgate, is a member of a prestigious science academy, as he hopes to convince him to back his project that he created, a serum that separates personalities, only to be rejected. The experiment would later attract the attention of Rumplestiltskin, who suddenly appears and helps Jekyll perfect the serum, and when Jekyll drinks it, he transforms into Hyde for the first time. That night at a party, Hyde, with the help of Rumplestiltskin, confronts Mary\u2019s father and threatens to expose the truth about him sleeping with his lab assistant if he doesn\u2019t grant Jekyll his membership into the academy. In the morning, Jekyll wakes up and remembers nothing but finds himself to be an academy member.Later on, Rumplestiltskin influences Jekyll to become Hyde again, this time to win over Mary, revealing that Jekyll has strong feelings for her, but she admits that she isn\u2019t interested in the same way and wants a man who wants to embrace passion without getting rid of it, and the two kiss. The following morning, Jekyll and Mary are waking up in bed together and are shocked by the outcome, as Jekyll tries to convince her that he is Hyde, but Mary is upset that Jekyll tricked her and tries to run away, prompting an angry Jekyll to push Mary out of the window and to her death. Realizing what he has done, Jekyll drinks the last of the serum and escapes as Hyde.In Storybrooke[edit]At the Pawn shop, Gold is looking in the mirror and sees his hair as he prepares to cut it, giving him a more crew cut appearance. He is soon visited by the Evil Queen and Hyde, who demanded a necklace. As Gold choked Hyde, he learned that he cannot be killed by The Evil Queen, although she tells Gold that their deal to protect Belle and the baby is still in effect. When news leaks of Hyde escaping the hospital, this suddenly disrupts the normally for David and Snow, as well as for Emma and Hook, who is ready to move in with her. When Regina and Jekyll shows off the necklace, they soon discover that the serum will be vital in defeating The Evil Queen and Hyde. With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering. Later on, Regina asks Gold for help, only to discover the Evil Queen and Hyde have already destroyed the lab but Jekyll managed to save a tiny bit of the serum which Regina wants to use on the Evil Queen. Gold to steals Jekyll\u2019s heart to convince Regina to hand over the serum which he then pours the serum onto his dagger which will be useful in killing Hyde. As Gold leaves, he tosses Jekyll\u2019s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.In the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, and this time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he switched serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One\u2019s dagger and uses it to control Gold to take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to \\\"do what is necessary\\\" to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of \\\"weakness,\\\" but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that \u201cnecessity\u201d will make her love him once again.Back at Storybrooke Elementary School, Snow resumes her role as teacher, and introduces her new assistant Shirin to the class. Realizing that the students are struggling, Shirin suggests that Snow embrace her past to inspire them. Taking a cue from Isaac Newton, Snow uses her experience as an archer and the students are in awe, winning her confidence with them. At the end of the school day, Shirin later meets up with the Oracle, where they are coordinating plans to search for Aladdin, as Shirin is revealed to be Princess Jasmine.Production[edit]- Rebecca Mader, who was credited in this episode, was not featured.- The episode features Jonny Coyne as Dr. Lydgate, reprising the role he originated in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, thus establishing Jekyll and Hyde's \\\"Victorian England\\\" as the same \\\"realm of story\\\" that was featured on that show.- The reason why Gold cuts his hair is because, during the break between the fifth and sixth seasons, Robert Carlyle had filmed Trainspotting 2 which required his hair to be shortened (Carlyle having worn a wig for the season's previous episodes).Reception[edit]Ratings[edit]The episode saw a drop from the previous outing, posting a 1.1/4 rating among 18-49s with 3.48 million tuning in.[1]Reviews[edit]- Justin Kirkland of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+.[2]- The AV Club gave out pointers on the episode, giving positive points on Jekyll and Hyde's backstory and twist, but were mixed on the premise and scenes.[3]- Christine Laskodi of TV Fantic gave the episode a good review: 4.0 out of 5.0[4]References[edit]- ^ \\\"TV Ratings Sunday: \u2018Simpsons\u2019 600th episode scores, \u2018Quantico\u2019 hits series low on mostly down night\\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (October 17, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time premiere recap: Strange Case'\\\" from Entertainment Weekly (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Jekyll and Hyde\u2019s \u201cStrange Case\u201d on Once Upon A Time melds good with evil\\\" from AV Club (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time Review: Strange Case\\\" from TV Fanatic (October 16, 2016)\",\"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case\",\"cleaned_text\": \"\\\"Strange Case\\\" is the fourth episode of the sixth season of the American fantasy drama series Once Upon a Time, which aired on October 16, 2016.

As Gold leaves, he tosses Jekyll\u2019s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.\\n\\nIn the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, and this time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he switched serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One\u2019s dagger and uses it to control Gold to take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to \\\"do what is necessary\\\" to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of \\\"weakness,\\\" but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that \u201cnecessity\u201d will make her love him once again.\\n\\nAt the end of the school day, Shirin later meets up with the Oracle, where they are coordinating plans to search for Aladdin, as Shirin is revealed to be Princess Jasmine.\"}] | 4 |who was the aztec ruler when the spanish arrived| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"history\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"historical\",\"research\",\"non-s(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Part of the (...TRUNCATED) | 1 |an open-source clone of unix created in the early 1990s| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"computers and electronics\",\"technical\",\"statement\",\"fact\",\"historical\",\"r(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"If you are a software developer in your 20s or 30s, you've grown up in a world dominat(...TRUNCATED) | 4 |when is an articulated lorry most likely to jackknife| [\"informational\",\"intermediate\",\"autos and vehicles\",\"technical\",\"question\",\"research\",\"fact\",\"non-s(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"This website uses cookies to improve your experience while you navigate through the we(...TRUNCATED) | 4 |how many mla and mp seats in telangana| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"law and government\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"research\",\"non-sen(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"2018 Telangana Legislative Assembly electionParts of this article (those related to so(...TRUNCATED) | 3 |does england have the right to bear arms| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"law and government\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"research\",\"non-sen(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"Passages of Arms: The English Bill of Rights and the American Second AmendmentSunday, (...TRUNCATED) | 1 |who won the champions league final in 2016| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"sports\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"historical\",\"research\",\"non-se(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"It was another epic encounter between these old rivals, featuring some of the best and(...TRUNCATED) | 4 |where do the hearts of palm come from| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"food and drink\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"research\",\"non-sensiti(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"Most of us have tried, or at least heard of, a vegetable called the heart of palm.

It consists of 10,000 queries sourced from multiple real-world and synthetically generated queries, specifically curated and repurposed for generative engines. The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty level, query intent, and other dimensions.UsageYou can easily load and use Geo-Bench in Python using the datasetslibrary:import datasets# Load Geo-Benchdataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"GEO-optim/geo-bench\")Data SourceGeo-Bench is a compilation of queries from various sources, both real and synthetically generated, to create a benchmark tailored for generative engines. The datasets used in constructing Geo-Bench are as follows:MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: These datasets contain real anonymized user queries from Bing and Google Search Engines, collectively representing common datasets used in search engine-related research.AIISouls: This dataset contains essay questions from \"All Souls College, Oxford University,\" challenging generative engines to perform reasoning and aggregate information from multiple sources.LIMA: Contains challenging questions requiring generative engines to not only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning to answer the question, such as writing short poems or generating Python code.Davinci-Debate: Contains debate questions generated for testing generative engines.Perplexity.ai Discover: These queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai's Discover section, an updated list of trending queries on the platform.EII-5: This dataset contains questions from the ELIS subreddit, where users ask complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman terms.GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query distribution, GPT-4 is prompted to generate queries ranging from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and difficulty levels (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).Apart from queries, we also provide 5 cleaned html responses based on top Google search results.TagsOptimizing website content often requires making targeted changes based on the domain of the task. Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature. To this end, we tag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For tagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall and precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated system, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered as the sole basis for filtering or analysis.Difficulty Level- The complexity of the query, ranging from simple to complex.- Example of a simple query: \"What is the capital of France?\"- Example of a complex query: \"What are the implications of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics?\"Nature of Query- The type of information sought by the query, such as factual, opinion, or comparison.- Example of a factual query: \"How does a car engine work?\"- Example of an opinion query: \"What is your opinion on the Harry Potter series?\"Genre- The category or domain of the query, such as arts and entertainment, finance, or science.- Example of a query in the arts and entertainment genre: \"Who won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020?\"- Example of a query in the finance genre: \"What is the current exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar?\"Specific Topics- The specific subject matter of the query, such as physics, economics, or computer science.- Example of a query on a specific topic in physics: \"What is the theory of relativity?\"- Example of a query on a specific topic in economics: \"What is the law of supply and demand?\"Sensitivity- Whether the query involves sensitive topics or not.- Example of a non-sensitive query: \"What is the tallest mountain in the world?\"- Example of a sensitive query: \"What is the current political situation in North Korea?\"User Intent- The purpose behind the user's query, such as research, purchase, or entertainment.- Example of a research intent query: \"What are the health benefits of a vegetarian diet?\"- Example of a purchase intent query: \"Where can I buy the latest iPhone?\"Answer Type- The format of the answer that the query is seeking, such as fact, opinion, or list.- Example of a fact answer type query: \"What is the population of New York City?\"- Example of an opinion answer type query: \"Is it better to buy or rent a house?\"Additional InformationGeo-Bench is intended for research purposes and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of content optimization for generative engines.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across stateYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deityFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.Members of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.However, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.Status: BannedOld Mysuru regionCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu HaisoduKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.The ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara,The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.Status: PractisedHubbaliRam Fight of Savji CommunitySomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.At present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.Status: Banned, illegally practisedHubbaliKobri Hori competitionKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.The bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.Status: Banned, illegally practisedMangaluru, UdupiCock fighting or kori katteAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.A special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.The event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from `20,000-`25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,\u201d said activist Ravi.According to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.Status: Banned, illegally practisedNorth KarnatakaBullock cart racingBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years. The event which was widely held across the state is now restricted to parts of north Karnataka. The races are held during Dasara and Diwali. Participants race in bullock carts and winners receive prize money.Status: No banUdupiBuffalo racing or kambalaKambala is an annual buffalo race organised by agrarian families after the harvest of Rabi crop. Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.In the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals. The game has become an organised rural sport with committees setting up schedules and cash prizes.The game is conducted across Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and even parts of Kasaragod in Kerala. However, the sport has been put on hold due to an interim ban by the High Court, following opposition by animal rights activists.Previously, despite a petition for a ban on the event by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA), the races were held with regulations issued by local district administration.status: Interim ban",

          "raw_source": "Traditional games have always been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. There are a variety of indoor, outdoor and board games that were popular in Karnataka. Many of these interesting games were played by both the young and the old.But with the advent of computers, mobile phones and play stations the concept of playing games have drastically changed in the state along with the rest of the country. Though a few of the traditional games are still played in Karnataka, people dwelling in the cities have lost touch with most of the traditional games.Let us take a look at some of the traditional games that were once enthusiastically played across Karnataka.Chinni Dandu (Gilli Danda)Gilli danda is one of the most popular outdoor games played all over India and even in South Asia. It is called Chinni Dandu in Kannada. This game is believed to be the origin of many European and American games such as Cricket, Baseball and Softball. The game is played with a peg (gilli) and a stick (danda), both of which are made of wood. The stick is used to strike the peg. It is a team game that requires hand eye co-ordination and concentration of the player.Buguri (Spinning the top)Spinning the top or Lattu is a fun game played across many parts of India and Pakistan. It is known as Buguri in Kannada. It is an interesting traditional game where a wooden top is made to spin. There are grooves in the lower half of the top and a nail at the bottom to spin on. A string is wrapped around the grooves to deploy the top and make it spin.Goti (Marbles)Popularly known as marbles, kancha or goli, it is a much loved gully sport in the country. It is called Goti in Kannada. This classic game requires the player to hit the selected target \u2018marble\u2019 using his/her own marble ball. The winner of the game walks away with all the marbles of the other players. This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.KabaddiKabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka. It requires the participants to lift round stone balls (called kallu gundu in Kannada) of various sizes and weights. The sport demands that the players be physically strong enough to lift heavy stones.PagadePagade is a cross and circle board game that is very similar to the ancient game of Pachisi or Chaupad. This game requires 2 or 4 players to race their respective pawns to reach the innermost square. The origin of the game can be traced to 4th century AD and it has remained popular throughout history.Chowka Bara (Chakaara)Chauka Bara is one of the oldest board games of India that is still played in some parts of the country. It is known as Chowka Bara in Mysuru and as Chakaara or Chakka in north Karnataka. This game is similar to ludo and can be played by 4 players. It is a game of chance that is played with cowry shells (called kavade in Kannada). The players attempt to race their pawns from the starting point to the safety of home. The game improves eye-to-eye coordination and teaches to make strategies.AshtapadaAshtapada is an Indian board game that originated before chess. The game is played on a board having eight-by-eight grid of squares of same colour and the board has special markings known as \u201ccastles\u201d. Each player has an even number of game pieces and the objective is to move a game piece around the board in clockwise direction, enter the castle, and regain the castle back in a counter-clockwise direction so as to make the game piece reach the center. It can be played by 2 or 4 players.Paramapada (Snakes & Ladders)Snakes & Ladders is a classic board game that originated in ancient India. It is known as Paramapada in Kannada. The game can be played by two or more players on a game-board that has numbered, gridded squares. The board has several ladders and snakes drawn on it. Players have to navigate their game piece from the start to the finish based on die rolls. The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.Ali Guli ManeAli Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.Lagori (Seven Stones)A stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.Adu Huli Aata (Tiger & Goat)Tiger and goat is a hunt game that is known as Adu Huli Aata in Kannada. The game is played between 2 players where one player gets 3 tigers and the other player has 15 goats. The game is about the tigers trying to kill the goats while the goats look for ways to immobilize the tigers. This game requires planning and concentration on part of both the players.Saalu Mane Ata (Nine Men\u2019s Morris)Nine Men\u2019s Morris is a traditional board game that originated in the western world. It is known as Saalu Mane Ata or Jodpi Ata or Char-Par in Kannada and is popular as Navakankari in various parts of India. This alignment game requires 2 players. Each player is given 9 coins and they try to achieve as many points as possible by getting 3 coins in a row on the game board. It is a complex game that requires strategic thinking.Kunte Bille (Hopscotch)Hopscotch is a traditional children\u2019s game that is known as Kunte Bille in Kannada. The game can be played alone or with several players. It involves drawing a court on the ground and then tossing a small object into the numbered rectangles of the court. The player then needs to hop or jump through the spaces in order to retrieve the object.Kambala (Buffalo Race)Kambala or Buffalo Race is a rural sport of Karnataka. This traditional sport involves farmers racing the buffaloes through tracks are ploughed into a muddy field that is made slushy with water. The sport is a source of much enjoyment for the rural folks of the state.Hagga Jaggata (Tug of War)Tug of war or rope pulling is an age-old sport that is known as Hagga Jaggata in Kannada. The sport involves two teams who pull on opposite ends of a rope in a test of strength. The objective is to pull the rope by both teams at opposite ends until one team drags the other over a central line.Naaku Kallu Aata (Four Stone)Four stone is an ancient traditional game that is known as Naaku Kallu Aata in Karnataka. It requires four independent boxes to be drawn on the ground. One player each stands in the four boxes and tries to take the four stones placed at the centre without being caught by the chaser in the game.Hand WrestlingHand wrestling is enthusiastically played by the folks of rural Karnataka. The game is played with hands where one player has to hold with both hand and fingers his opponent\u2019s hand under the wrist joint very tightly.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.\\n\\nDr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.\\nHistory\\nDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father.\\n\\nJekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories.\\n\\nStill in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner.\\n\\nWhen the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde.\\n\\nAt the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with.\\n\\nJekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it.

The Storybrooke events take place after \\\"The Other Shoe\\\".In the Characters' Past[edit]In Victorian England, Dr. Jekyll is joined by his friend Mary Lydgate, whose father, Dr. Lydgate, is a member of a prestigious science academy, as he hopes to convince him to back his project that he created, a serum that separates personalities, only to be rejected. The experiment would later attract the attention of Rumplestiltskin, who suddenly appears and helps Jekyll perfect the serum, and when Jekyll drinks it, he transforms into Hyde for the first time. That night at a party, Hyde, with the help of Rumplestiltskin, confronts Mary\u2019s father and threatens to expose the truth about him sleeping with his lab assistant if he doesn\u2019t grant Jekyll his membership into the academy. In the morning, Jekyll wakes up and remembers nothing but finds himself to be an academy member.Later on, Rumplestiltskin influences Jekyll to become Hyde again, this time to win over Mary, revealing that Jekyll has strong feelings for her, but she admits that she isn\u2019t interested in the same way and wants a man who wants to embrace passion without getting rid of it, and the two kiss. The following morning, Jekyll and Mary are waking up in bed together and are shocked by the outcome, as Jekyll tries to convince her that he is Hyde, but Mary is upset that Jekyll tricked her and tries to run away, prompting an angry Jekyll to push Mary out of the window and to her death. Realizing what he has done, Jekyll drinks the last of the serum and escapes as Hyde.In Storybrooke[edit]At the Pawn shop, Gold is looking in the mirror and sees his hair as he prepares to cut it, giving him a more crew cut appearance. He is soon visited by the Evil Queen and Hyde, who demanded a necklace. As Gold choked Hyde, he learned that he cannot be killed by The Evil Queen, although she tells Gold that their deal to protect Belle and the baby is still in effect. When news leaks of Hyde escaping the hospital, this suddenly disrupts the normally for David and Snow, as well as for Emma and Hook, who is ready to move in with her. When Regina and Jekyll shows off the necklace, they soon discover that the serum will be vital in defeating The Evil Queen and Hyde. With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering. Later on, Regina asks Gold for help, only to discover the Evil Queen and Hyde have already destroyed the lab but Jekyll managed to save a tiny bit of the serum which Regina wants to use on the Evil Queen. Gold to steals Jekyll\u2019s heart to convince Regina to hand over the serum which he then pours the serum onto his dagger which will be useful in killing Hyde. As Gold leaves, he tosses Jekyll\u2019s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.In the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, and this time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he switched serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One\u2019s dagger and uses it to control Gold to take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to \\\"do what is necessary\\\" to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of \\\"weakness,\\\" but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that \u201cnecessity\u201d will make her love him once again.Back at Storybrooke Elementary School, Snow resumes her role as teacher, and introduces her new assistant Shirin to the class. Realizing that the students are struggling, Shirin suggests that Snow embrace her past to inspire them. Taking a cue from Isaac Newton, Snow uses her experience as an archer and the students are in awe, winning her confidence with them. At the end of the school day, Shirin later meets up with the Oracle, where they are coordinating plans to search for Aladdin, as Shirin is revealed to be Princess Jasmine.Production[edit]- Rebecca Mader, who was credited in this episode, was not featured.- The episode features Jonny Coyne as Dr. Lydgate, reprising the role he originated in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, thus establishing Jekyll and Hyde's \\\"Victorian England\\\" as the same \\\"realm of story\\\" that was featured on that show.- The reason why Gold cuts his hair is because, during the break between the fifth and sixth seasons, Robert Carlyle had filmed Trainspotting 2 which required his hair to be shortened (Carlyle having worn a wig for the season's previous episodes).Reception[edit]Ratings[edit]The episode saw a drop from the previous outing, posting a 1.1/4 rating among 18-49s with 3.48 million tuning in.[1]Reviews[edit]- Justin Kirkland of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+.[2]- The AV Club gave out pointers on the episode, giving positive points on Jekyll and Hyde's backstory and twist, but were mixed on the premise and scenes.[3]- Christine Laskodi of TV Fantic gave the episode a good review: 4.0 out of 5.0[4]References[edit]- ^ \\\"TV Ratings Sunday: \u2018Simpsons\u2019 600th episode scores, \u2018Quantico\u2019 hits series low on mostly down night\\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (October 17, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time premiere recap: Strange Case'\\\" from Entertainment Weekly (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Jekyll and Hyde\u2019s \u201cStrange Case\u201d on Once Upon A Time melds good with evil\\\" from AV Club (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time Review: Strange Case\\\" from TV Fanatic (October 16, 2016)\",\"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case\",\"cleaned_text\": \"\\\"Strange Case\\\" is the fourth episode of the sixth season of the American fantasy drama series Once Upon a Time, which aired on October 16, 2016.

It consists of 10,000 queries sourced from multiple real-world and synthetically generated queries, specifically curated and repurposed for generative engines. The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty level, query intent, and other dimensions.UsageYou can easily load and use Geo-Bench in Python using the datasetslibrary:import datasets# Load Geo-Benchdataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"GEO-optim/geo-bench\")Data SourceGeo-Bench is a compilation of queries from various sources, both real and synthetically generated, to create a benchmark tailored for generative engines. The datasets used in constructing Geo-Bench are as follows:MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: These datasets contain real anonymized user queries from Bing and Google Search Engines, collectively representing common datasets used in search engine-related research.AIISouls: This dataset contains essay questions from \"All Souls College, Oxford University,\" challenging generative engines to perform reasoning and aggregate information from multiple sources.LIMA: Contains challenging questions requiring generative engines to not only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning to answer the question, such as writing short poems or generating Python code.Davinci-Debate: Contains debate questions generated for testing generative engines.Perplexity.ai Discover: These queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai's Discover section, an updated list of trending queries on the platform.EII-5: This dataset contains questions from the ELIS subreddit, where users ask complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman terms.GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query distribution, GPT-4 is prompted to generate queries ranging from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and difficulty levels (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).Apart from queries, we also provide 5 cleaned html responses based on top Google search results.TagsOptimizing website content often requires making targeted changes based on the domain of the task. Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature. To this end, we tag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For tagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall and precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated system, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered as the sole basis for filtering or analysis.Difficulty Level- The complexity of the query, ranging from simple to complex.- Example of a simple query: \"What is the capital of France?\"- Example of a complex query: \"What are the implications of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics?\"Nature of Query- The type of information sought by the query, such as factual, opinion, or comparison.- Example of a factual query: \"How does a car engine work?\"- Example of an opinion query: \"What is your opinion on the Harry Potter series?\"Genre- The category or domain of the query, such as arts and entertainment, finance, or science.- Example of a query in the arts and entertainment genre: \"Who won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020?\"- Example of a query in the finance genre: \"What is the current exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar?\"Specific Topics- The specific subject matter of the query, such as physics, economics, or computer science.- Example of a query on a specific topic in physics: \"What is the theory of relativity?\"- Example of a query on a specific topic in economics: \"What is the law of supply and demand?\"Sensitivity- Whether the query involves sensitive topics or not.- Example of a non-sensitive query: \"What is the tallest mountain in the world?\"- Example of a sensitive query: \"What is the current political situation in North Korea?\"User Intent- The purpose behind the user's query, such as research, purchase, or entertainment.- Example of a research intent query: \"What are the health benefits of a vegetarian diet?\"- Example of a purchase intent query: \"Where can I buy the latest iPhone?\"Answer Type- The format of the answer that the query is seeking, such as fact, opinion, or list.- Example of a fact answer type query: \"What is the population of New York City?\"- Example of an opinion answer type query: \"Is it better to buy or rent a house?\"Additional InformationGeo-Bench is intended for research purposes and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of content optimization for generative engines.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across stateYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deityFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.Members of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.However, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.Status: BannedOld Mysuru regionCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu HaisoduKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.The ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara,The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.Status: PractisedHubbaliRam Fight of Savji CommunitySomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.At present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.Status: Banned, illegally practisedHubbaliKobri Hori competitionKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.The bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.Status: Banned, illegally practisedMangaluru, UdupiCock fighting or kori katteAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.A special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.The event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from `20,000-`25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,\u201d said activist Ravi.According to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.Status: Banned, illegally practisedNorth KarnatakaBullock cart racingBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years. The event which was widely held across the state is now restricted to parts of north Karnataka. The races are held during Dasara and Diwali. Participants race in bullock carts and winners receive prize money.Status: No banUdupiBuffalo racing or kambalaKambala is an annual buffalo race organised by agrarian families after the harvest of Rabi crop. Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.In the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals.

            "raw_source": "Traditional games have always been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. There are a variety of indoor, outdoor and board games that were popular in Karnataka. Many of these interesting games were played by both the young and the old.But with the advent of computers, mobile phones and play stations the concept of playing games have drastically changed in the state along with the rest of the country. Though a few of the traditional games are still played in Karnataka, people dwelling in the cities have lost touch with most of the traditional games.Let us take a look at some of the traditional games that were once enthusiastically played across Karnataka.Chinni Dandu (Gilli Danda)Gilli danda is one of the most popular outdoor games played all over India and even in South Asia. It is called Chinni Dandu in Kannada. This game is believed to be the origin of many European and American games such as Cricket, Baseball and Softball.

It is a team game that requires hand eye co-ordination and concentration of the player.Buguri (Spinning the top)Spinning the top or Lattu is a fun game played across many parts of India and Pakistan. It is known as Buguri in Kannada. It is an interesting traditional game where a wooden top is made to spin. There are grooves in the lower half of the top and a nail at the bottom to spin on. A string is wrapped around the grooves to deploy the top and make it spin.Goti (Marbles)Popularly known as marbles, kancha or goli, it is a much loved gully sport in the country. It is called Goti in Kannada. This classic game requires the player to hit the selected target \u2018marble\u2019 using his/her own marble ball. The winner of the game walks away with all the marbles of the other players. This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.KabaddiKabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka. It requires the participants to lift round stone balls (called kallu gundu in Kannada) of various sizes and weights. The sport demands that the players be physically strong enough to lift heavy stones.PagadePagade is a cross and circle board game that is very similar to the ancient game of Pachisi or Chaupad. This game requires 2 or 4 players to race their respective pawns to reach the innermost square. The origin of the game can be traced to 4th century AD and it has remained popular throughout history.Chowka Bara (Chakaara)Chauka Bara is one of the oldest board games of India that is still played in some parts of the country. It is known as Chowka Bara in Mysuru and as Chakaara or Chakka in north Karnataka. This game is similar to ludo and can be played by 4 players. It is a game of chance that is played with cowry shells (called kavade in Kannada). The players attempt to race their pawns from the starting point to the safety of home. The game improves eye-to-eye coordination and teaches to make strategies.AshtapadaAshtapada is an Indian board game that originated before chess. The game is played on a board having eight-by-eight grid of squares of same colour and the board has special markings known as \u201ccastles\u201d. Each player has an even number of game pieces and the objective is to move a game piece around the board in clockwise direction, enter the castle, and regain the castle back in a counter-clockwise direction so as to make the game piece reach the center. It can be played by 2 or 4 players.Paramapada (Snakes & Ladders)Snakes & Ladders is a classic board game that originated in ancient India. It is known as Paramapada in Kannada. The game can be played by two or more players on a game-board that has numbered, gridded squares. The board has several ladders and snakes drawn on it. Players have to navigate their game piece from the start to the finish based on die rolls. The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.Ali Guli ManeAli Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.Lagori (Seven Stones)A stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.Adu Huli Aata (Tiger & Goat)Tiger and goat is a hunt game that is known as Adu Huli Aata in Kannada.

The player then needs to hop or jump through the spaces in order to retrieve the object.Kambala (Buffalo Race)Kambala or Buffalo Race is a rural sport of Karnataka. This traditional sport involves farmers racing the buffaloes through tracks are ploughed into a muddy field that is made slushy with water.

It requires four independent boxes to be drawn on the ground. One player each stands in the four boxes and tries to take the four stones placed at the centre without being caught by the chaser in the game.Hand WrestlingHand wrestling is enthusiastically played by the folks of rural Karnataka.

Place the stones on the floor or any flat surface. Pick one stone, toss it in the air, and while that stone is in the air, pick another stone from the ground, while catching the stone tossed in the air before it hits the ground. Repeat this with the rest of the stones.\\n\\nYou can continue this game by picking up different numbers of stones from the floor, or even throwing a different number of stones into the air, and then picking up other stones before other stones fall. It is important that you should not let the stones tossed in the air fall on the ground. It requires some practice, but once you master it, you can enjoy hours of entertainment.\\n\\n3. Ashtapada\\n\\nAshtapada is the predecessor of chess. Just like a chessboard, the Ashtapada board is also divided into an 8\u00d78 square grids but of one color. Ashtapada is a dice game. There are markings on the corners and the center square of the board. These squares are called castles. The pieces on these squares are safe, captured, or removed by the opponents.\\n\\nEach player starts with an even number of pieces to play the game. The pieces must be moved clockwise around the board to enter the castle on the outer edge. Then they enter the castle in the center in a clockwise direction. This is a game to reach the castle.\\n\\nAnother variation of Ashtapada is Dasapada that is played on a 10\u00d710 board.\\n4. Chaturanga\\n\\nChaturanga is an ancient strategy game invented in India. It is believed to be the ancestor of strategy games, such as Chess, Xiangqi, Shogi, and Makruk. Chaturanga is mentioned in many ancient scripts. It is played on the Ashtapada board. There are two players.\\n\\nJust like modern chess, Chaturanga has various pieces \u2014 the King (Raja), General (Mantri or Senapati), Rook (Ratha), Elephant/Bishop (Gaja), Horse/Knight (Ashva), and Pawn (Padaati or Bhata). Each piece moves in a certain direction.\\n\\nThe ultimate goal is to get the opponent\u2019s king into trouble so that he cannot move without being taken by the enemy. Kings and generals played this game to gain new ideas about the form of war offensive.\\n\\n5. Pallankuzhi\\n\\nIt is believed that this ancient game originated in Tamil Nadu but later spread to other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka. This game gained popularity even in Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The game is still played in some rural parts of India and is called Kuzhipara, Ali Guli Mane, or Picchala Peeta in different languages.\\n\\nIn this game, we use a rectangular board that is divided into two rows and seven cups. Players must use 146 counters to put in these cups. These counters are usually cowrie shells or tamarind shells. Each cup contains 12 counters. In the middle row cups, only two counters are placed. There are two players taking turns.\\n\\nThe starting player picks the counters from any of the holes on their side and assigns a counter to each cup in a counterclockwise direction. Once they reach the end of their cups, they move on to their opponent\u2019s cups. When their counters are over, they pick the counters from the next cup and continue the game. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the next cup are captured by the player. The next player takes over.\\n\\nThe game continues until the last counter falls in a cup with two empty cups beyond it. The player can capture no more counters, and their turn is over.\\n\\nIn this intricate game, there are other rules that make it interesting. Although this game is best played between two players, even one person can play the game on a lazy afternoon. Pallankuzhi can be played by both children and adults.\\n\\n6. Antakshari\\n\\nAntakshari is one of the most popular traditional Indian games. The game is played widely in social gatherings and weddings. Children play it in their free time at school. The best thing about this game is that it can also be played in a small space, just like when traveling in a car.\\n\\nAntakshari is the best way to spend time. You need to have a repertoire of songs to play this game. You can play this game in a team. Each team sings in turns, starting from the last letter of the previous song sung by the other team.\\n\\n7. Moksha Patam\\n\\nMoksha Patam or Parama Padam is a board game that is believed to have been invented in ancient India and has spread to other parts of the world. Now, it is commonly called Snakes and Ladders. In ancient India, it was used as a form of entertainment and to teach morality to children.\\n\\nThe basic concept is to teach people that the way to reach heaven or \u201cmoksha\u201d is to abandon the bondage of passion. The ladder symbolizes the rise from one level of enlightenment to another, while the snake symbolizes immoral behavior and how they lead to degeneration. This game is played by two to four players. The first player to reach the \u201chighest heaven\u201d is the winner.\\n\\n8. Aadu puli aatam\\n\\nAadu puli aatam literally means \u201ca game of lambs and tigers.\u201d It is called meka puli aata in Telugu and aadu huli aata in Kannada. This is a two-player game where the tigers hunt goats on an asymmetric grid.\\n\\nIn this game, first, draw a triangle and divide it into three equal parts. Then, draw a rectangle on the entire triangle, intersecting it throughout. Then divide the rectangle horizontally into two parts. One player has 15 \u201cgoats,\u201d and the other player has three \u201ctigers.\u201d Each of these pieces is placed at the intersection point. Tigers try to eat goats, and goats try to actively stop them. The pieces are usually cowrie shells or pebbles.\\n\\n9. Chowkabara\\n\\nThis is another four-player game that is similar to Chaupar or Ludo. The goal of the game is to achieve home safety without getting removed by the opponents\u2019 pieces. The game is popular all over India and is known under different names, such as Eight and Four, Kattam Kalo, Chauka Baara, Changapoo, Ettu Veedu, Kattam Kazhi, and Aada Sada.\\n\\n10. Pancha kone\\n\\nPancha kone is a popular Indian traditional game.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.\\n\\nDr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.\\nHistory\\nDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father.\\n\\nJekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories.\\n\\nStill in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner.\\n\\nWhen the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde.\\n\\nAt the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with.\\n\\nJekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece.\\n\\n\"},{\"raw_text\": \"On the Season 6 premiere episode of Once Upon a Time, \u2018The Savior,\u2019 while refugees from the Land of Untold Stories invade Storybrooke and in a flashback Jafar (Oded Fehr) confronts Aladdin (Deniz Akdeniz), Emma (Jennifer Morrison) and the heroes try to stop Mr. Hyde which won\u2019t be easy.

It consists of 10,000 queries sourced from multiple real-world and synthetically generated queries, specifically curated and repurposed for generative engines. The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty level, query intent, and other dimensions.UsageYou can easily load and use Geo-Bench in Python using the datasetslibrary:import datasets# Load Geo-Benchdataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"GEO-optim/geo-bench\")Data SourceGeo-Bench is a compilation of queries from various sources, both real and synthetically generated, to create a benchmark tailored for generative engines. The datasets used in constructing Geo-Bench are as follows:MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: These datasets contain real anonymized user queries from Bing and Google Search Engines, collectively representing common datasets used in search engine-related research.AIISouls: This dataset contains essay questions from \"All Souls College, Oxford University,\" challenging generative engines to perform reasoning and aggregate information from multiple sources.LIMA: Contains challenging questions requiring generative engines to not only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning to answer the question, such as writing short poems or generating Python code.Davinci-Debate: Contains debate questions generated for testing generative engines.Perplexity.ai Discover: These queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai's Discover section, an updated list of trending queries on the platform.EII-5: This dataset contains questions from the ELIS subreddit, where users ask complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman terms.GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query distribution, GPT-4 is prompted to generate queries ranging from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and difficulty levels (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).Apart from queries, we also provide 5 cleaned html responses based on top Google search results.TagsOptimizing website content often requires making targeted changes based on the domain of the task. Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature. To this end, we tag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For tagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall and precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated system, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered as the sole basis for filtering or analysis.Difficulty Level- The complexity of the query, ranging from simple to complex.- Example of a simple query: \"What is the capital of France?\"- Example of a complex query: \"What are the implications of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics?\"Nature of Query- The type of information sought by the query, such as factual, opinion, or comparison.- Example of a factual query: \"How does a car engine work?\"- Example of an opinion query: \"What is your opinion on the Harry Potter series?\"Genre- The category or domain of the query, such as arts and entertainment, finance, or science.- Example of a query in the arts and entertainment genre: \"Who won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020?\"- Example of a query in the finance genre: \"What is the current exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar?\"Specific Topics- The specific subject matter of the query, such as physics, economics, or computer science.- Example of a query on a specific topic in physics: \"What is the theory of relativity?\"- Example of a query on a specific topic in economics: \"What is the law of supply and demand?\"Sensitivity- Whether the query involves sensitive topics or not.- Example of a non-sensitive query: \"What is the tallest mountain in the world?\"- Example of a sensitive query: \"What is the current political situation in North Korea?\"User Intent- The purpose behind the user's query, such as research, purchase, or entertainment.- Example of a research intent query: \"What are the health benefits of a vegetarian diet?\"- Example of a purchase intent query: \"Where can I buy the latest iPhone?\"Answer Type- The format of the answer that the query is seeking, such as fact, opinion, or list.- Example of a fact answer type query: \"What is the population of New York City?\"- Example of an opinion answer type query: \"Is it better to buy or rent a house?\"Additional InformationGeo-Bench is intended for research purposes and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of content optimization for generative engines.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across stateYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deityFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.Members of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.However, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.Status: BannedOld Mysuru regionCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu HaisoduKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.The ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara,The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.Status: PractisedHubbaliRam Fight of Savji CommunitySomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.At present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.Status: Banned, illegally practisedHubbaliKobri Hori competitionKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.The bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.Status: Banned, illegally practisedMangaluru, UdupiCock fighting or kori katteAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.A special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.The event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from `20,000-`25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,\u201d said activist Ravi.According to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.Status: Banned, illegally practisedNorth KarnatakaBullock cart racingBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years.

Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.In the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals. The game has become an organised rural sport with committees setting up schedules and cash prizes.The game is conducted across Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and even parts of Kasaragod in Kerala. However, the sport has been put on hold due to an interim ban by the High Court, following opposition by animal rights activists.Previously, despite a petition for a ban on the event by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA), the races were held with regulations issued by local district administration.status: Interim ban",

It is called Chinni Dandu in Kannada. This game is believed to be the origin of many European and American games such as Cricket, Baseball and Softball. The game is played with a peg (gilli) and a stick (danda), both of which are made of wood. The stick is used to strike the peg. It is a team game that requires hand eye co-ordination and concentration of the player.Buguri (Spinning the top)Spinning the top or Lattu is a fun game played across many parts of India and Pakistan. It is known as Buguri in Kannada. It is an interesting traditional game where a wooden top is made to spin. There are grooves in the lower half of the top and a nail at the bottom to spin on. A string is wrapped around the grooves to deploy the top and make it spin.Goti (Marbles)Popularly known as marbles, kancha or goli, it is a much loved gully sport in the country. It is called Goti in Kannada. This classic game requires the player to hit the selected target \u2018marble\u2019 using his/her own marble ball. The winner of the game walks away with all the marbles of the other players. This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.KabaddiKabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka. It requires the participants to lift round stone balls (called kallu gundu in Kannada) of various sizes and weights. The sport demands that the players be physically strong enough to lift heavy stones.PagadePagade is a cross and circle board game that is very similar to the ancient game of Pachisi or Chaupad. This game requires 2 or 4 players to race their respective pawns to reach the innermost square. The origin of the game can be traced to 4th century AD and it has remained popular throughout history.Chowka Bara (Chakaara)Chauka Bara is one of the oldest board games of India that is still played in some parts of the country. It is known as Chowka Bara in Mysuru and as Chakaara or Chakka in north Karnataka. This game is similar to ludo and can be played by 4 players. It is a game of chance that is played with cowry shells (called kavade in Kannada). The players attempt to race their pawns from the starting point to the safety of home. The game improves eye-to-eye coordination and teaches to make strategies.AshtapadaAshtapada is an Indian board game that originated before chess. The game is played on a board having eight-by-eight grid of squares of same colour and the board has special markings known as \u201ccastles\u201d. Each player has an even number of game pieces and the objective is to move a game piece around the board in clockwise direction, enter the castle, and regain the castle back in a counter-clockwise direction so as to make the game piece reach the center. It can be played by 2 or 4 players.Paramapada (Snakes & Ladders)Snakes & Ladders is a classic board game that originated in ancient India. It is known as Paramapada in Kannada. The game can be played by two or more players on a game-board that has numbered, gridded squares. The board has several ladders and snakes drawn on it. Players have to navigate their game piece from the start to the finish based on die rolls. The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.Ali Guli ManeAli Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.Lagori (Seven Stones)A stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.Adu Huli Aata (Tiger & Goat)Tiger and goat is a hunt game that is known as Adu Huli Aata in Kannada. The game is played between 2 players where one player gets 3 tigers and the other player has 15 goats. The game is about the tigers trying to kill the goats while the goats look for ways to immobilize the tigers.

Each player is given 9 coins and they try to achieve as many points as possible by getting 3 coins in a row on the game board. It is a complex game that requires strategic thinking.Kunte Bille (Hopscotch)Hopscotch is a traditional children\u2019s game that is known as Kunte Bille in Kannada. The game can be played alone or with several players. It involves drawing a court on the ground and then tossing a small object into the numbered rectangles of the court. The player then needs to hop or jump through the spaces in order to retrieve the object.Kambala (Buffalo Race)Kambala or Buffalo Race is a rural sport of Karnataka. This traditional sport involves farmers racing the buffaloes through tracks are ploughed into a muddy field that is made slushy with water. The sport is a source of much enjoyment for the rural folks of the state.Hagga Jaggata (Tug of War)Tug of war or rope pulling is an age-old sport that is known as Hagga Jaggata in Kannada. The sport involves two teams who pull on opposite ends of a rope in a test of strength. The objective is to pull the rope by both teams at opposite ends until one team drags the other over a central line.Naaku Kallu Aata (Four Stone)Four stone is an ancient traditional game that is known as Naaku Kallu Aata in Karnataka. It requires four independent boxes to be drawn on the ground. One player each stands in the four boxes and tries to take the four stones placed at the centre without being caught by the chaser in the game.Hand WrestlingHand wrestling is enthusiastically played by the folks of rural Karnataka. The game is played with hands where one player has to hold with both hand and fingers his opponent\u2019s hand under the wrist joint very tightly. The objective of the game is to prevent the opponent from freeing his hand from the player\u2019s clutches. Then the player must free his own hand from the opponent\u2019s clutch when his turn comes.These are just a few of the exciting traditional games that were once an integral part of Karnataka\u2019s heritage. There are several other games that have been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. But most of these games are on the verge of being erased from people\u2019s memory these days. These traditional games can be enjoyed even today. Several of these games are quite interesting to play and can help to keep children away from the clutches of electronic games they constantly play on computers and mobiles.Also see,",

Pachisi/Chaupar\\n\\nPachisi or Chaupar is a well-known board game since it was the genesis of the Kurukshetra war in Mahabharata. The Mughals were fond of this game, too. Pachisi was traditionally played on a symmetrical cross cloth. On the other hand, Chaupar was a board game invented in the 4th century.\\n\\nIn both these games, two to four players use cowrie shells and dice to plan their maneuvers and attack opponents. Now, you call this game Ludo, one of the more popular games today. Pachisi or Chaupar is an excellent game to teach your child how to plan and execute.\\n\\n2. Anchankal/Kallankal\\n\\nThis game is widely played in Tamil Nadu. As the name of the game suggests, Anchankal is a game composed of five stones. The game improves hand-eye coordination, concentration, memory, and aiming abilities. This is a very engaging game, and the best part is that you can create your own steps.\\n\\nIn the original game, you use five smooth stones that can be held in your hand. Place the stones on the floor or any flat surface. Pick one stone, toss it in the air, and while that stone is in the air, pick another stone from the ground, while catching the stone tossed in the air before it hits the ground. Repeat this with the rest of the stones.\\n\\nYou can continue this game by picking up different numbers of stones from the floor, or even throwing a different number of stones into the air, and then picking up other stones before other stones fall. It is important that you should not let the stones tossed in the air fall on the ground. It requires some practice, but once you master it, you can enjoy hours of entertainment.\\n\\n3. Ashtapada\\n\\nAshtapada is the predecessor of chess. Just like a chessboard, the Ashtapada board is also divided into an 8\u00d78 square grids but of one color. Ashtapada is a dice game. There are markings on the corners and the center square of the board. These squares are called castles. The pieces on these squares are safe, captured, or removed by the opponents.\\n\\nEach player starts with an even number of pieces to play the game. The pieces must be moved clockwise around the board to enter the castle on the outer edge. Then they enter the castle in the center in a clockwise direction. This is a game to reach the castle.\\n\\nAnother variation of Ashtapada is Dasapada that is played on a 10\u00d710 board.\\n4. Chaturanga\\n\\nChaturanga is an ancient strategy game invented in India. It is believed to be the ancestor of strategy games, such as Chess, Xiangqi, Shogi, and Makruk. Chaturanga is mentioned in many ancient scripts. It is played on the Ashtapada board. There are two players.\\n\\nJust like modern chess, Chaturanga has various pieces \u2014 the King (Raja), General (Mantri or Senapati), Rook (Ratha), Elephant/Bishop (Gaja), Horse/Knight (Ashva), and Pawn (Padaati or Bhata). Each piece moves in a certain direction.\\n\\nThe ultimate goal is to get the opponent\u2019s king into trouble so that he cannot move without being taken by the enemy. Kings and generals played this game to gain new ideas about the form of war offensive.\\n\\n5. Pallankuzhi\\n\\nIt is believed that this ancient game originated in Tamil Nadu but later spread to other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka. This game gained popularity even in Sri Lanka and Malaysia.

Players must use 146 counters to put in these cups. These counters are usually cowrie shells or tamarind shells. Each cup contains 12 counters. In the middle row cups, only two counters are placed. There are two players taking turns.\\n\\nThe starting player picks the counters from any of the holes on their side and assigns a counter to each cup in a counterclockwise direction. Once they reach the end of their cups, they move on to their opponent\u2019s cups. When their counters are over, they pick the counters from the next cup and continue the game. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the next cup are captured by the player. The next player takes over.\\n\\nThe game continues until the last counter falls in a cup with two empty cups beyond it. The player can capture no more counters, and their turn is over.\\n\\nIn this intricate game, there are other rules that make it interesting. Although this game is best played between two players, even one person can play the game on a lazy afternoon. Pallankuzhi can be played by both children and adults.\\n\\n6.

Each team sings in turns, starting from the last letter of the previous song sung by the other team.\\n\\n7.

Now, it is commonly called Snakes and Ladders. In ancient India, it was used as a form of entertainment and to teach morality to children.\\n\\nThe basic concept is to teach people that the way to reach heaven or \u201cmoksha\u201d is to abandon the bondage of passion. The ladder symbolizes the rise from one level of enlightenment to another, while the snake symbolizes immoral behavior and how they lead to degeneration. This game is played by two to four players. The first player to reach the \u201chighest heaven\u201d is the winner.\\n\\n8.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.\\n\\nDr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.\\nHistory\\nDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father.\\n\\nJekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories.\\n\\nStill in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner.\\n\\nWhen the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde.\\n\\nAt the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with.\\n\\nJekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece.\\n\\n\"},{\"raw_text\": \"For the Enchanted Forest character, see Prince Henry.For the Land Without Magic character, see Henry Mills.For the Wish Realm character, see Henry (Wish Realm).Doctor Henry Jekyll, formerly known as the Groundsman, is a character on ABC's Once Upon a Time.

The Storybrooke events take place after \\\"The Other Shoe\\\".In the Characters' Past[edit]In Victorian England, Dr. Jekyll is joined by his friend Mary Lydgate, whose father, Dr. Lydgate, is a member of a prestigious science academy, as he hopes to convince him to back his project that he created, a serum that separates personalities, only to be rejected. The experiment would later attract the attention of Rumplestiltskin, who suddenly appears and helps Jekyll perfect the serum, and when Jekyll drinks it, he transforms into Hyde for the first time. That night at a party, Hyde, with the help of Rumplestiltskin, confronts Mary\u2019s father and threatens to expose the truth about him sleeping with his lab assistant if he doesn\u2019t grant Jekyll his membership into the academy. In the morning, Jekyll wakes up and remembers nothing but finds himself to be an academy member.Later on, Rumplestiltskin influences Jekyll to become Hyde again, this time to win over Mary, revealing that Jekyll has strong feelings for her, but she admits that she isn\u2019t interested in the same way and wants a man who wants to embrace passion without getting rid of it, and the two kiss. The following morning, Jekyll and Mary are waking up in bed together and are shocked by the outcome, as Jekyll tries to convince her that he is Hyde, but Mary is upset that Jekyll tricked her and tries to run away, prompting an angry Jekyll to push Mary out of the window and to her death. Realizing what he has done, Jekyll drinks the last of the serum and escapes as Hyde.In Storybrooke[edit]At the Pawn shop, Gold is looking in the mirror and sees his hair as he prepares to cut it, giving him a more crew cut appearance. He is soon visited by the Evil Queen and Hyde, who demanded a necklace. As Gold choked Hyde, he learned that he cannot be killed by The Evil Queen, although she tells Gold that their deal to protect Belle and the baby is still in effect. When news leaks of Hyde escaping the hospital, this suddenly disrupts the normally for David and Snow, as well as for Emma and Hook, who is ready to move in with her. When Regina and Jekyll shows off the necklace, they soon discover that the serum will be vital in defeating The Evil Queen and Hyde. With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering. Later on, Regina asks Gold for help, only to discover the Evil Queen and Hyde have already destroyed the lab but Jekyll managed to save a tiny bit of the serum which Regina wants to use on the Evil Queen. Gold to steals Jekyll\u2019s heart to convince Regina to hand over the serum which he then pours the serum onto his dagger which will be useful in killing Hyde. As Gold leaves, he tosses Jekyll\u2019s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.In the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, and this time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he switched serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One\u2019s dagger and uses it to control Gold to take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to \\\"do what is necessary\\\" to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of \\\"weakness,\\\" but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that \u201cnecessity\u201d will make her love him once again.Back at Storybrooke Elementary School, Snow resumes her role as teacher, and introduces her new assistant Shirin to the class. Realizing that the students are struggling, Shirin suggests that Snow embrace her past to inspire them. Taking a cue from Isaac Newton, Snow uses her experience as an archer and the students are in awe, winning her confidence with them. At the end of the school day, Shirin later meets up with the Oracle, where they are coordinating plans to search for Aladdin, as Shirin is revealed to be Princess Jasmine.Production[edit]- Rebecca Mader, who was credited in this episode, was not featured.- The episode features Jonny Coyne as Dr. Lydgate, reprising the role he originated in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, thus establishing Jekyll and Hyde's \\\"Victorian England\\\" as the same \\\"realm of story\\\" that was featured on that show.- The reason why Gold cuts his hair is because, during the break between the fifth and sixth seasons, Robert Carlyle had filmed Trainspotting 2 which required his hair to be shortened (Carlyle having worn a wig for the season's previous episodes).Reception[edit]Ratings[edit]The episode saw a drop from the previous outing, posting a 1.1/4 rating among 18-49s with 3.48 million tuning in.[1]Reviews[edit]- Justin Kirkland of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+.[2]- The AV Club gave out pointers on the episode, giving positive points on Jekyll and Hyde's backstory and twist, but were mixed on the premise and scenes.[3]- Christine Laskodi of TV Fantic gave the episode a good review: 4.0 out of 5.0[4]References[edit]- ^ \\\"TV Ratings Sunday: \u2018Simpsons\u2019 600th episode scores, \u2018Quantico\u2019 hits series low on mostly down night\\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (October 17, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time premiere recap: Strange Case'\\\" from Entertainment Weekly (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Jekyll and Hyde\u2019s \u201cStrange Case\u201d on Once Upon A Time melds good with evil\\\" from AV Club (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time Review: Strange Case\\\" from TV Fanatic (October 16, 2016)\",\"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case\",\"cleaned_text\": \"\\\"Strange Case\\\" is the fourth episode of the sixth season of the American fantasy drama series Once Upon a Time, which aired on October 16, 2016.

It consists of 10,000 queries sourced from multiple real-world and synthetically generated queries, specifically curated and repurposed for generative engines. The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty level, query intent, and other dimensions.UsageYou can easily load and use Geo-Bench in Python using the datasetslibrary:import datasets# Load Geo-Benchdataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"GEO-optim/geo-bench\")Data SourceGeo-Bench is a compilation of queries from various sources, both real and synthetically generated, to create a benchmark tailored for generative engines. The datasets used in constructing Geo-Bench are as follows:MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: These datasets contain real anonymized user queries from Bing and Google Search Engines, collectively representing common datasets used in search engine-related research.AIISouls: This dataset contains essay questions from \"All Souls College, Oxford University,\" challenging generative engines to perform reasoning and aggregate information from multiple sources.LIMA: Contains challenging questions requiring generative engines to not only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning to answer the question, such as writing short poems or generating Python code.Davinci-Debate: Contains debate questions generated for testing generative engines.Perplexity.ai Discover: These queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai's Discover section, an updated list of trending queries on the platform.EII-5: This dataset contains questions from the ELIS subreddit, where users ask complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman terms.GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query distribution, GPT-4 is prompted to generate queries ranging from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and difficulty levels (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).Apart from queries, we also provide 5 cleaned html responses based on top Google search results.TagsOptimizing website content often requires making targeted changes based on the domain of the task. Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature. To this end, we tag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For tagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall and precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated system, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered as the sole basis for filtering or analysis.Difficulty Level- The complexity of the query, ranging from simple to complex.- Example of a simple query: \"What is the capital of France?\"- Example of a complex query: \"What are the implications of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics?\"Nature of Query- The type of information sought by the query, such as factual, opinion, or comparison.- Example of a factual query: \"How does a car engine work?\"- Example of an opinion query: \"What is your opinion on the Harry Potter series?\"Genre- The category or domain of the query, such as arts and entertainment, finance, or science.- Example of a query in the arts and entertainment genre: \"Who won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020?\"- Example of a query in the finance genre: \"What is the current exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar?\"Specific Topics- The specific subject matter of the query, such as physics, economics, or computer science.- Example of a query on a specific topic in physics: \"What is the theory of relativity?\"- Example of a query on a specific topic in economics: \"What is the law of supply and demand?\"Sensitivity- Whether the query involves sensitive topics or not.- Example of a non-sensitive query: \"What is the tallest mountain in the world?\"- Example of a sensitive query: \"What is the current political situation in North Korea?\"User Intent- The purpose behind the user's query, such as research, purchase, or entertainment.- Example of a research intent query: \"What are the health benefits of a vegetarian diet?\"- Example of a purchase intent query: \"Where can I buy the latest iPhone?\"Answer Type- The format of the answer that the query is seeking, such as fact, opinion, or list.- Example of a fact answer type query: \"What is the population of New York City?\"- Example of an opinion answer type query: \"Is it better to buy or rent a house?\"Additional InformationGeo-Bench is intended for research purposes and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of content optimization for generative engines.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across stateYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deityFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.Members of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.However, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.Status: BannedOld Mysuru regionCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu HaisoduKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.The ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara,The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.Status: PractisedHubbaliRam Fight of Savji CommunitySomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.At present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.Status: Banned, illegally practisedHubbaliKobri Hori competitionKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.The bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.Status: Banned, illegally practisedMangaluru, UdupiCock fighting or kori katteAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.A special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.The event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from `20,000-`25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,\u201d said activist Ravi.According to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.Status: Banned, illegally practisedNorth KarnatakaBullock cart racingBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years. The event which was widely held across the state is now restricted to parts of north Karnataka. The races are held during Dasara and Diwali. Participants race in bullock carts and winners receive prize money.Status: No banUdupiBuffalo racing or kambalaKambala is an annual buffalo race organised by agrarian families after the harvest of Rabi crop. Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.In the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals.

Many of these interesting games were played by both the young and the old.But with the advent of computers, mobile phones and play stations the concept of playing games have drastically changed in the state along with the rest of the country. Though a few of the traditional games are still played in Karnataka, people dwelling in the cities have lost touch with most of the traditional games.Let us take a look at some of the traditional games that were once enthusiastically played across Karnataka.Chinni Dandu (Gilli Danda)Gilli danda is one of the most popular outdoor games played all over India and even in South Asia. It is called Chinni Dandu in Kannada. This game is believed to be the origin of many European and American games such as Cricket, Baseball and Softball.

It is a team game that requires hand eye co-ordination and concentration of the player.Buguri (Spinning the top)Spinning the top or Lattu is a fun game played across many parts of India and Pakistan. It is known as Buguri in Kannada. It is an interesting traditional game where a wooden top is made to spin. There are grooves in the lower half of the top and a nail at the bottom to spin on. A string is wrapped around the grooves to deploy the top and make it spin.Goti (Marbles)Popularly known as marbles, kancha or goli, it is a much loved gully sport in the country. It is called Goti in Kannada. This classic game requires the player to hit the selected target \u2018marble\u2019 using his/her own marble ball. The winner of the game walks away with all the marbles of the other players. This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.KabaddiKabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka. It requires the participants to lift round stone balls (called kallu gundu in Kannada) of various sizes and weights.

The game is played on a board having eight-by-eight grid of squares of same colour and the board has special markings known as \u201ccastles\u201d.

It can be played by 2 or 4 players.Paramapada (Snakes & Ladders)Snakes & Ladders is a classic board game that originated in ancient India. It is known as Paramapada in Kannada.

Players have to navigate their game piece from the start to the finish based on die rolls. The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.Ali Guli ManeAli Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.Lagori (Seven Stones)A stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.Adu Huli Aata (Tiger & Goat)Tiger and goat is a hunt game that is known as Adu Huli Aata in Kannada.

Repeat this with the rest of the stones.\\n\\nYou can continue this game by picking up different numbers of stones from the floor, or even throwing a different number of stones into the air, and then picking up other stones before other stones fall. It is important that you should not let the stones tossed in the air fall on the ground. It requires some practice, but once you master it, you can enjoy hours of entertainment.\\n\\n3. Ashtapada\\n\\nAshtapada is the predecessor of chess. Just like a chessboard, the Ashtapada board is also divided into an 8\u00d78 square grids but of one color. Ashtapada is a dice game. There are markings on the corners and the center square of the board. These squares are called castles. The pieces on these squares are safe, captured, or removed by the opponents.\\n\\nEach player starts with an even number of pieces to play the game. The pieces must be moved clockwise around the board to enter the castle on the outer edge. Then they enter the castle in the center in a clockwise direction. This is a game to reach the castle.\\n\\nAnother variation of Ashtapada is Dasapada that is played on a 10\u00d710 board.\\n4. Chaturanga\\n\\nChaturanga is an ancient strategy game invented in India. It is believed to be the ancestor of strategy games, such as Chess, Xiangqi, Shogi, and Makruk. Chaturanga is mentioned in many ancient scripts. It is played on the Ashtapada board. There are two players.\\n\\nJust like modern chess, Chaturanga has various pieces \u2014 the King (Raja), General (Mantri or Senapati), Rook (Ratha), Elephant/Bishop (Gaja), Horse/Knight (Ashva), and Pawn (Padaati or Bhata). Each piece moves in a certain direction.\\n\\nThe ultimate goal is to get the opponent\u2019s king into trouble so that he cannot move without being taken by the enemy. Kings and generals played this game to gain new ideas about the form of war offensive.\\n\\n5. Pallankuzhi\\n\\nIt is believed that this ancient game originated in Tamil Nadu but later spread to other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka. This game gained popularity even in Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The game is still played in some rural parts of India and is called Kuzhipara, Ali Guli Mane, or Picchala Peeta in different languages.\\n\\nIn this game, we use a rectangular board that is divided into two rows and seven cups. Players must use 146 counters to put in these cups. These counters are usually cowrie shells or tamarind shells. Each cup contains 12 counters. In the middle row cups, only two counters are placed. There are two players taking turns.\\n\\nThe starting player picks the counters from any of the holes on their side and assigns a counter to each cup in a counterclockwise direction. Once they reach the end of their cups, they move on to their opponent\u2019s cups. When their counters are over, they pick the counters from the next cup and continue the game. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the next cup are captured by the player. The next player takes over.\\n\\nThe game continues until the last counter falls in a cup with two empty cups beyond it. The player can capture no more counters, and their turn is over.\\n\\nIn this intricate game, there are other rules that make it interesting. Although this game is best played between two players, even one person can play the game on a lazy afternoon. Pallankuzhi can be played by both children and adults.\\n\\n6. Antakshari\\n\\nAntakshari is one of the most popular traditional Indian games. The game is played widely in social gatherings and weddings. Children play it in their free time at school. The best thing about this game is that it can also be played in a small space, just like when traveling in a car.\\n\\nAntakshari is the best way to spend time. You need to have a repertoire of songs to play this game. You can play this game in a team. Each team sings in turns, starting from the last letter of the previous song sung by the other team.\\n\\n7. Moksha Patam\\n\\nMoksha Patam or Parama Padam is a board game that is believed to have been invented in ancient India and has spread to other parts of the world. Now, it is commonly called Snakes and Ladders. In ancient India, it was used as a form of entertainment and to teach morality to children.\\n\\nThe basic concept is to teach people that the way to reach heaven or \u201cmoksha\u201d is to abandon the bondage of passion. The ladder symbolizes the rise from one level of enlightenment to another, while the snake symbolizes immoral behavior and how they lead to degeneration. This game is played by two to four players. The first player to reach the \u201chighest heaven\u201d is the winner.\\n\\n8. Aadu puli aatam\\n\\nAadu puli aatam literally means \u201ca game of lambs and tigers.\u201d It is called meka puli aata in Telugu and aadu huli aata in Kannada. This is a two-player game where the tigers hunt goats on an asymmetric grid.\\n\\nIn this game, first, draw a triangle and divide it into three equal parts. Then, draw a rectangle on the entire triangle, intersecting it throughout. Then divide the rectangle horizontally into two parts. One player has 15 \u201cgoats,\u201d and the other player has three \u201ctigers.\u201d Each of these pieces is placed at the intersection point. Tigers try to eat goats, and goats try to actively stop them. The pieces are usually cowrie shells or pebbles.\\n\\n9. Chowkabara\\n\\nThis is another four-player game that is similar to Chaupar or Ludo. The goal of the game is to achieve home safety without getting removed by the opponents\u2019 pieces. The game is popular all over India and is known under different names, such as Eight and Four, Kattam Kalo, Chauka Baara, Changapoo, Ettu Veedu, Kattam Kazhi, and Aada Sada.\\n\\n10. Pancha kone\\n\\nPancha kone is a popular Indian traditional game.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.\\n\\nDr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.\\nHistory\\nDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father.\\n\\nJekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories.\\n\\nStill in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner.\\n\\nWhen the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde.\\n\\nAt the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with.\\n\\nJekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece.\\n\\n\"},{\"raw_text\": \"On the Season 6 premiere episode of Once Upon a Time, \u2018The Savior,\u2019 while refugees from the Land of Untold Stories invade Storybrooke and in a flashback Jafar (Oded Fehr) confronts Aladdin (Deniz Akdeniz), Emma (Jennifer Morrison) and the heroes try to stop Mr. Hyde which won\u2019t be easy.

It consists of 10,000 queries sourced from multiple real-world and synthetically generated queries, specifically curated and repurposed for generative engines. The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty level, query intent, and other dimensions.UsageYou can easily load and use Geo-Bench in Python using the datasetslibrary:import datasets# Load Geo-Benchdataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"GEO-optim/geo-bench\")Data SourceGeo-Bench is a compilation of queries from various sources, both real and synthetically generated, to create a benchmark tailored for generative engines. The datasets used in constructing Geo-Bench are as follows:MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: These datasets contain real anonymized user queries from Bing and Google Search Engines, collectively representing common datasets used in search engine-related research.AIISouls: This dataset contains essay questions from \"All Souls College, Oxford University,\" challenging generative engines to perform reasoning and aggregate information from multiple sources.LIMA: Contains challenging questions requiring generative engines to not only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning to answer the question, such as writing short poems or generating Python code.Davinci-Debate: Contains debate questions generated for testing generative engines.Perplexity.ai Discover: These queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai's Discover section, an updated list of trending queries on the platform.EII-5: This dataset contains questions from the ELIS subreddit, where users ask complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman terms.GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query distribution, GPT-4 is prompted to generate queries ranging from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and difficulty levels (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).Apart from queries, we also provide 5 cleaned html responses based on top Google search results.TagsOptimizing website content often requires making targeted changes based on the domain of the task. Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature. To this end, we tag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For tagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall and precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated system, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered as the sole basis for filtering or analysis.Difficulty Level- The complexity of the query, ranging from simple to complex.- Example of a simple query: \"What is the capital of France?\"- Example of a complex query: \"What are the implications of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics?\"Nature of Query- The type of information sought by the query, such as factual, opinion, or comparison.- Example of a factual query: \"How does a car engine work?\"- Example of an opinion query: \"What is your opinion on the Harry Potter series?\"Genre- The category or domain of the query, such as arts and entertainment, finance, or science.- Example of a query in the arts and entertainment genre: \"Who won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020?\"- Example of a query in the finance genre: \"What is the current exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar?\"Specific Topics- The specific subject matter of the query, such as physics, economics, or computer science.- Example of a query on a specific topic in physics: \"What is the theory of relativity?\"- Example of a query on a specific topic in economics: \"What is the law of supply and demand?\"Sensitivity- Whether the query involves sensitive topics or not.- Example of a non-sensitive query: \"What is the tallest mountain in the world?\"- Example of a sensitive query: \"What is the current political situation in North Korea?\"User Intent- The purpose behind the user's query, such as research, purchase, or entertainment.- Example of a research intent query: \"What are the health benefits of a vegetarian diet?\"- Example of a purchase intent query: \"Where can I buy the latest iPhone?\"Answer Type- The format of the answer that the query is seeking, such as fact, opinion, or list.- Example of a fact answer type query: \"What is the population of New York City?\"- Example of an opinion answer type query: \"Is it better to buy or rent a house?\"Additional InformationGeo-Bench is intended for research purposes and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of content optimization for generative engines.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across stateYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deityFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.Members of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.However, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.Status: BannedOld Mysuru regionCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu HaisoduKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.The ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire.

The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara,The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.Status: PractisedHubbaliRam Fight of Savji CommunitySomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.At present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.Status: Banned, illegally practisedHubbaliKobri Hori competitionKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport.

Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.Status: Banned, illegally practisedMangaluru, UdupiCock fighting or kori katteAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.A special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.The event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court.

Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.In the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals. The game has become an organised rural sport with committees setting up schedules and cash prizes.The game is conducted across Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and even parts of Kasaragod in Kerala. However, the sport has been put on hold due to an interim ban by the High Court, following opposition by animal rights activists.Previously, despite a petition for a ban on the event by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA), the races were held with regulations issued by local district administration.status: Interim ban",

It is known as Buguri in Kannada. It is an interesting traditional game where a wooden top is made to spin. There are grooves in the lower half of the top and a nail at the bottom to spin on. A string is wrapped around the grooves to deploy the top and make it spin.Goti (Marbles)Popularly known as marbles, kancha or goli, it is a much loved gully sport in the country. It is called Goti in Kannada. This classic game requires the player to hit the selected target \u2018marble\u2019 using his/her own marble ball. The winner of the game walks away with all the marbles of the other players. This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.KabaddiKabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka. It requires the participants to lift round stone balls (called kallu gundu in Kannada) of various sizes and weights. The sport demands that the players be physically strong enough to lift heavy stones.PagadePagade is a cross and circle board game that is very similar to the ancient game of Pachisi or Chaupad. This game requires 2 or 4 players to race their respective pawns to reach the innermost square. The origin of the game can be traced to 4th century AD and it has remained popular throughout history.Chowka Bara (Chakaara)Chauka Bara is one of the oldest board games of India that is still played in some parts of the country. It is known as Chowka Bara in Mysuru and as Chakaara or Chakka in north Karnataka. This game is similar to ludo and can be played by 4 players. It is a game of chance that is played with cowry shells (called kavade in Kannada). The players attempt to race their pawns from the starting point to the safety of home. The game improves eye-to-eye coordination and teaches to make strategies.AshtapadaAshtapada is an Indian board game that originated before chess. The game is played on a board having eight-by-eight grid of squares of same colour and the board has special markings known as \u201ccastles\u201d. Each player has an even number of game pieces and the objective is to move a game piece around the board in clockwise direction, enter the castle, and regain the castle back in a counter-clockwise direction so as to make the game piece reach the center. It can be played by 2 or 4 players.Paramapada (Snakes & Ladders)Snakes & Ladders is a classic board game that originated in ancient India. It is known as Paramapada in Kannada. The game can be played by two or more players on a game-board that has numbered, gridded squares. The board has several ladders and snakes drawn on it. Players have to navigate their game piece from the start to the finish based on die rolls. The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.Ali Guli ManeAli Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.Lagori (Seven Stones)A stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.Adu Huli Aata (Tiger & Goat)Tiger and goat is a hunt game that is known as Adu Huli Aata in Kannada. The game is played between 2 players where one player gets 3 tigers and the other player has 15 goats. The game is about the tigers trying to kill the goats while the goats look for ways to immobilize the tigers.

It is a complex game that requires strategic thinking.Kunte Bille (Hopscotch)Hopscotch is a traditional children\u2019s game that is known as Kunte Bille in Kannada. The game can be played alone or with several players. It involves drawing a court on the ground and then tossing a small object into the numbered rectangles of the court. The player then needs to hop or jump through the spaces in order to retrieve the object.Kambala (Buffalo Race)Kambala or Buffalo Race is a rural sport of Karnataka. This traditional sport involves farmers racing the buffaloes through tracks are ploughed into a muddy field that is made slushy with water. The sport is a source of much enjoyment for the rural folks of the state.Hagga Jaggata (Tug of War)Tug of war or rope pulling is an age-old sport that is known as Hagga Jaggata in Kannada. The sport involves two teams who pull on opposite ends of a rope in a test of strength. The objective is to pull the rope by both teams at opposite ends until one team drags the other over a central line.Naaku Kallu Aata (Four Stone)Four stone is an ancient traditional game that is known as Naaku Kallu Aata in Karnataka. It requires four independent boxes to be drawn on the ground. One player each stands in the four boxes and tries to take the four stones placed at the centre without being caught by the chaser in the game.Hand WrestlingHand wrestling is enthusiastically played by the folks of rural Karnataka. The game is played with hands where one player has to hold with both hand and fingers his opponent\u2019s hand under the wrist joint very tightly. The objective of the game is to prevent the opponent from freeing his hand from the player\u2019s clutches. Then the player must free his own hand from the opponent\u2019s clutch when his turn comes.These are just a few of the exciting traditional games that were once an integral part of Karnataka\u2019s heritage. There are several other games that have been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. But most of these games are on the verge of being erased from people\u2019s memory these days. These traditional games can be enjoyed even today. Several of these games are quite interesting to play and can help to keep children away from the clutches of electronic games they constantly play on computers and mobiles.Also see,",

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.\\n\\nDr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.\\nHistory\\nDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father.\\n\\nJekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories.\\n\\nStill in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner.\\n\\nWhen the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde.\\n\\nAt the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with.\\n\\nJekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece.\\n\\n\"},{\"raw_text\": \"For the Enchanted Forest character, see Prince Henry.For the Land Without Magic character, see Henry Mills.For the Wish Realm character, see Henry (Wish Realm).Doctor Henry Jekyll, formerly known as the Groundsman, is a character on ABC's Once Upon a Time.

The Storybrooke events take place after \\\"The Other Shoe\\\".In the Characters' Past[edit]In Victorian England, Dr. Jekyll is joined by his friend Mary Lydgate, whose father, Dr. Lydgate, is a member of a prestigious science academy, as he hopes to convince him to back his project that he created, a serum that separates personalities, only to be rejected. The experiment would later attract the attention of Rumplestiltskin, who suddenly appears and helps Jekyll perfect the serum, and when Jekyll drinks it, he transforms into Hyde for the first time. That night at a party, Hyde, with the help of Rumplestiltskin, confronts Mary\u2019s father and threatens to expose the truth about him sleeping with his lab assistant if he doesn\u2019t grant Jekyll his membership into the academy. In the morning, Jekyll wakes up and remembers nothing but finds himself to be an academy member.Later on, Rumplestiltskin influences Jekyll to become Hyde again, this time to win over Mary, revealing that Jekyll has strong feelings for her, but she admits that she isn\u2019t interested in the same way and wants a man who wants to embrace passion without getting rid of it, and the two kiss. The following morning, Jekyll and Mary are waking up in bed together and are shocked by the outcome, as Jekyll tries to convince her that he is Hyde, but Mary is upset that Jekyll tricked her and tries to run away, prompting an angry Jekyll to push Mary out of the window and to her death. Realizing what he has done, Jekyll drinks the last of the serum and escapes as Hyde.In Storybrooke[edit]At the Pawn shop, Gold is looking in the mirror and sees his hair as he prepares to cut it, giving him a more crew cut appearance. He is soon visited by the Evil Queen and Hyde, who demanded a necklace. As Gold choked Hyde, he learned that he cannot be killed by The Evil Queen, although she tells Gold that their deal to protect Belle and the baby is still in effect. When news leaks of Hyde escaping the hospital, this suddenly disrupts the normally for David and Snow, as well as for Emma and Hook, who is ready to move in with her. When Regina and Jekyll shows off the necklace, they soon discover that the serum will be vital in defeating The Evil Queen and Hyde. With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering. Later on, Regina asks Gold for help, only to discover the Evil Queen and Hyde have already destroyed the lab but Jekyll managed to save a tiny bit of the serum which Regina wants to use on the Evil Queen. Gold to steals Jekyll\u2019s heart to convince Regina to hand over the serum which he then pours the serum onto his dagger which will be useful in killing Hyde. As Gold leaves, he tosses Jekyll\u2019s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.In the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, and this time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he switched serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One\u2019s dagger and uses it to control Gold to take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to \\\"do what is necessary\\\" to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of \\\"weakness,\\\" but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that \u201cnecessity\u201d will make her love him once again.Back at Storybrooke Elementary School, Snow resumes her role as teacher, and introduces her new assistant Shirin to the class. Realizing that the students are struggling, Shirin suggests that Snow embrace her past to inspire them. Taking a cue from Isaac Newton, Snow uses her experience as an archer and the students are in awe, winning her confidence with them. At the end of the school day, Shirin later meets up with the Oracle, where they are coordinating plans to search for Aladdin, as Shirin is revealed to be Princess Jasmine.Production[edit]- Rebecca Mader, who was credited in this episode, was not featured.- The episode features Jonny Coyne as Dr. Lydgate, reprising the role he originated in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, thus establishing Jekyll and Hyde's \\\"Victorian England\\\" as the same \\\"realm of story\\\" that was featured on that show.- The reason why Gold cuts his hair is because, during the break between the fifth and sixth seasons, Robert Carlyle had filmed Trainspotting 2 which required his hair to be shortened (Carlyle having worn a wig for the season's previous episodes).Reception[edit]Ratings[edit]The episode saw a drop from the previous outing, posting a 1.1/4 rating among 18-49s with 3.48 million tuning in.[1]Reviews[edit]- Justin Kirkland of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+.[2]- The AV Club gave out pointers on the episode, giving positive points on Jekyll and Hyde's backstory and twist, but were mixed on the premise and scenes.[3]- Christine Laskodi of TV Fantic gave the episode a good review: 4.0 out of 5.0[4]References[edit]- ^ \\\"TV Ratings Sunday: \u2018Simpsons\u2019 600th episode scores, \u2018Quantico\u2019 hits series low on mostly down night\\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (October 17, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time premiere recap: Strange Case'\\\" from Entertainment Weekly (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Jekyll and Hyde\u2019s \u201cStrange Case\u201d on Once Upon A Time melds good with evil\\\" from AV Club (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time Review: Strange Case\\\" from TV Fanatic (October 16, 2016)\",\"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case\",\"cleaned_text\": \"\\\"Strange Case\\\" is the fourth episode of the sixth season of the American fantasy drama series Once Upon a Time, which aired on October 16, 2016.

It consists of 10,000 queries sourced from multiple real-world and synthetically generated queries, specifically curated and repurposed for generative engines. The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty level, query intent, and other dimensions.UsageYou can easily load and use Geo-Bench in Python using the datasetslibrary:import datasets# Load Geo-Benchdataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"GEO-optim/geo-bench\")Data SourceGeo-Bench is a compilation of queries from various sources, both real and synthetically generated, to create a benchmark tailored for generative engines. The datasets used in constructing Geo-Bench are as follows:MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: These datasets contain real anonymized user queries from Bing and Google Search Engines, collectively representing common datasets used in search engine-related research.AIISouls: This dataset contains essay questions from \"All Souls College, Oxford University,\" challenging generative engines to perform reasoning and aggregate information from multiple sources.LIMA: Contains challenging questions requiring generative engines to not only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning to answer the question, such as writing short poems or generating Python code.Davinci-Debate: Contains debate questions generated for testing generative engines.Perplexity.ai Discover: These queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai's Discover section, an updated list of trending queries on the platform.EII-5: This dataset contains questions from the ELIS subreddit, where users ask complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman terms.GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query distribution, GPT-4 is prompted to generate queries ranging from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and difficulty levels (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).Apart from queries, we also provide 5 cleaned html responses based on top Google search results.TagsOptimizing website content often requires making targeted changes based on the domain of the task. Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature. To this end, we tag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For tagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall and precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated system, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered as the sole basis for filtering or analysis.Difficulty Level- The complexity of the query, ranging from simple to complex.- Example of a simple query: \"What is the capital of France?\"- Example of a complex query: \"What are the implications of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics?\"Nature of Query- The type of information sought by the query, such as factual, opinion, or comparison.- Example of a factual query: \"How does a car engine work?\"- Example of an opinion query: \"What is your opinion on the Harry Potter series?\"Genre- The category or domain of the query, such as arts and entertainment, finance, or science.- Example of a query in the arts and entertainment genre: \"Who won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020?\"- Example of a query in the finance genre: \"What is the current exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar?\"Specific Topics- The specific subject matter of the query, such as physics, economics, or computer science.- Example of a query on a specific topic in physics: \"What is the theory of relativity?\"- Example of a query on a specific topic in economics: \"What is the law of supply and demand?\"Sensitivity- Whether the query involves sensitive topics or not.- Example of a non-sensitive query: \"What is the tallest mountain in the world?\"- Example of a sensitive query: \"What is the current political situation in North Korea?\"User Intent- The purpose behind the user's query, such as research, purchase, or entertainment.- Example of a research intent query: \"What are the health benefits of a vegetarian diet?\"- Example of a purchase intent query: \"Where can I buy the latest iPhone?\"Answer Type- The format of the answer that the query is seeking, such as fact, opinion, or list.- Example of a fact answer type query: \"What is the population of New York City?\"- Example of an opinion answer type query: \"Is it better to buy or rent a house?\"Additional InformationGeo-Bench is intended for research purposes and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of content optimization for generative engines.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across stateYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deityFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.Members of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.However, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.Status: BannedOld Mysuru regionCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu HaisoduKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.The ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara,The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.Status: PractisedHubbaliRam Fight of Savji CommunitySomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.At present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.Status: Banned, illegally practisedHubbaliKobri Hori competitionKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.The bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.Status: Banned, illegally practisedMangaluru, UdupiCock fighting or kori katteAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.A special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.The event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from `20,000-`25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,\u201d said activist Ravi.According to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.Status: Banned, illegally practisedNorth KarnatakaBullock cart racingBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years. The event which was widely held across the state is now restricted to parts of north Karnataka. The races are held during Dasara and Diwali. Participants race in bullock carts and winners receive prize money.Status: No banUdupiBuffalo racing or kambalaKambala is an annual buffalo race organised by agrarian families after the harvest of Rabi crop. Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.In the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals.

            "raw_source": "Traditional games have always been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. There are a variety of indoor, outdoor and board games that were popular in Karnataka. Many of these interesting games were played by both the young and the old.But with the advent of computers, mobile phones and play stations the concept of playing games have drastically changed in the state along with the rest of the country. Though a few of the traditional games are still played in Karnataka, people dwelling in the cities have lost touch with most of the traditional games.Let us take a look at some of the traditional games that were once enthusiastically played across Karnataka.Chinni Dandu (Gilli Danda)Gilli danda is one of the most popular outdoor games played all over India and even in South Asia. It is called Chinni Dandu in Kannada. This game is believed to be the origin of many European and American games such as Cricket, Baseball and Softball.

A string is wrapped around the grooves to deploy the top and make it spin.Goti (Marbles)Popularly known as marbles, kancha or goli, it is a much loved gully sport in the country. It is called Goti in Kannada. This classic game requires the player to hit the selected target \u2018marble\u2019 using his/her own marble ball. The winner of the game walks away with all the marbles of the other players. This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.KabaddiKabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka. It requires the participants to lift round stone balls (called kallu gundu in Kannada) of various sizes and weights. The sport demands that the players be physically strong enough to lift heavy stones.PagadePagade is a cross and circle board game that is very similar to the ancient game of Pachisi or Chaupad. This game requires 2 or 4 players to race their respective pawns to reach the innermost square. The origin of the game can be traced to 4th century AD and it has remained popular throughout history.Chowka Bara (Chakaara)Chauka Bara is one of the oldest board games of India that is still played in some parts of the country.

The game is played on a board having eight-by-eight grid of squares of same colour and the board has special markings known as \u201ccastles\u201d.

It can be played by 2 or 4 players.Paramapada (Snakes & Ladders)Snakes & Ladders is a classic board game that originated in ancient India. It is known as Paramapada in Kannada. The game can be played by two or more players on a game-board that has numbered, gridded squares. The board has several ladders and snakes drawn on it. Players have to navigate their game piece from the start to the finish based on die rolls. The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.Ali Guli ManeAli Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.Lagori (Seven Stones)A stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.Adu Huli Aata (Tiger & Goat)Tiger and goat is a hunt game that is known as Adu Huli Aata in Kannada.

It requires four independent boxes to be drawn on the ground. One player each stands in the four boxes and tries to take the four stones placed at the centre without being caught by the chaser in the game.Hand WrestlingHand wrestling is enthusiastically played by the folks of rural Karnataka. The game is played with hands where one player has to hold with both hand and fingers his opponent\u2019s hand under the wrist joint very tightly. The objective of the game is to prevent the opponent from freeing his hand from the player\u2019s clutches. Then the player must free his own hand from the opponent\u2019s clutch when his turn comes.These are just a few of the exciting traditional games that were once an integral part of Karnataka\u2019s heritage. There are several other games that have been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. But most of these games are on the verge of being erased from people\u2019s memory these days.

Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised.

Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair.

They are a part of India\u2019s rich heritage, history, and culture. They have been mentioned in many ancient Indian scriptures indicating their existence for many centuries. With the increasing prevalence of video games, online games, and gaming gadgets, these traditional games have lost their importance. However, these games should not be forgotten, and schools may also consider adding them to the curriculum as they include physical exercises and are a lot of fun. They help children improve their motor and social skills. Read this post to know about these and many other indoor and outdoor traditional Indian games.\\n\\nTraditional Indian Indoor Games\\nTraditional Indian indoor games usually require a lot of mental work and improve children\u2019s problem-solving skills. Some of these games have also been adopted by the Western world, and now we know them by their more popular English names.\\n\\n1. Pachisi/Chaupar\\n\\nPachisi or Chaupar is a well-known board game since it was the genesis of the Kurukshetra war in Mahabharata. The Mughals were fond of this game, too. Pachisi was traditionally played on a symmetrical cross cloth. On the other hand, Chaupar was a board game invented in the 4th century.\\n\\nIn both these games, two to four players use cowrie shells and dice to plan their maneuvers and attack opponents. Now, you call this game Ludo, one of the more popular games today. Pachisi or Chaupar is an excellent game to teach your child how to plan and execute.\\n\\n2. Anchankal/Kallankal\\n\\nThis game is widely played in Tamil Nadu. As the name of the game suggests, Anchankal is a game composed of five stones. The game improves hand-eye coordination, concentration, memory, and aiming abilities. This is a very engaging game, and the best part is that you can create your own steps.\\n\\nIn the original game, you use five smooth stones that can be held in your hand. Place the stones on the floor or any flat surface. Pick one stone, toss it in the air, and while that stone is in the air, pick another stone from the ground, while catching the stone tossed in the air before it hits the ground. Repeat this with the rest of the stones.\\n\\nYou can continue this game by picking up different numbers of stones from the floor, or even throwing a different number of stones into the air, and then picking up other stones before other stones fall. It is important that you should not let the stones tossed in the air fall on the ground. It requires some practice, but once you master it, you can enjoy hours of entertainment.\\n\\n3. Ashtapada\\n\\nAshtapada is the predecessor of chess. Just like a chessboard, the Ashtapada board is also divided into an 8\u00d78 square grids but of one color. Ashtapada is a dice game. There are markings on the corners and the center square of the board. These squares are called castles. The pieces on these squares are safe, captured, or removed by the opponents.\\n\\nEach player starts with an even number of pieces to play the game. The pieces must be moved clockwise around the board to enter the castle on the outer edge. Then they enter the castle in the center in a clockwise direction. This is a game to reach the castle.\\n\\nAnother variation of Ashtapada is Dasapada that is played on a 10\u00d710 board.\\n4. Chaturanga\\n\\nChaturanga is an ancient strategy game invented in India. It is believed to be the ancestor of strategy games, such as Chess, Xiangqi, Shogi, and Makruk. Chaturanga is mentioned in many ancient scripts. It is played on the Ashtapada board. There are two players.\\n\\nJust like modern chess, Chaturanga has various pieces \u2014 the King (Raja), General (Mantri or Senapati), Rook (Ratha), Elephant/Bishop (Gaja), Horse/Knight (Ashva), and Pawn (Padaati or Bhata). Each piece moves in a certain direction.\\n\\nThe ultimate goal is to get the opponent\u2019s king into trouble so that he cannot move without being taken by the enemy. Kings and generals played this game to gain new ideas about the form of war offensive.\\n\\n5. Pallankuzhi\\n\\nIt is believed that this ancient game originated in Tamil Nadu but later spread to other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka. This game gained popularity even in Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The game is still played in some rural parts of India and is called Kuzhipara, Ali Guli Mane, or Picchala Peeta in different languages.\\n\\nIn this game, we use a rectangular board that is divided into two rows and seven cups. Players must use 146 counters to put in these cups. These counters are usually cowrie shells or tamarind shells. Each cup contains 12 counters. In the middle row cups, only two counters are placed. There are two players taking turns.\\n\\nThe starting player picks the counters from any of the holes on their side and assigns a counter to each cup in a counterclockwise direction. Once they reach the end of their cups, they move on to their opponent\u2019s cups. When their counters are over, they pick the counters from the next cup and continue the game. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the next cup are captured by the player. The next player takes over.\\n\\nThe game continues until the last counter falls in a cup with two empty cups beyond it. The player can capture no more counters, and their turn is over.\\n\\nIn this intricate game, there are other rules that make it interesting. Although this game is best played between two players, even one person can play the game on a lazy afternoon. Pallankuzhi can be played by both children and adults.\\n\\n6. Antakshari\\n\\nAntakshari is one of the most popular traditional Indian games. The game is played widely in social gatherings and weddings. Children play it in their free time at school. The best thing about this game is that it can also be played in a small space, just like when traveling in a car.\\n\\nAntakshari is the best way to spend time. You need to have a repertoire of songs to play this game. You can play this game in a team. Each team sings in turns, starting from the last letter of the previous song sung by the other team.\\n\\n7. Moksha Patam\\n\\nMoksha Patam or Parama Padam is a board game that is believed to have been invented in ancient India and has spread to other parts of the world. Now, it is commonly called Snakes and Ladders. In ancient India, it was used as a form of entertainment and to teach morality to children.\\n\\nThe basic concept is to teach people that the way to reach heaven or \u201cmoksha\u201d is to abandon the bondage of passion. The ladder symbolizes the rise from one level of enlightenment to another, while the snake symbolizes immoral behavior and how they lead to degeneration. This game is played by two to four players. The first player to reach the \u201chighest heaven\u201d is the winner.\\n\\n8. Aadu puli aatam\\n\\nAadu puli aatam literally means \u201ca game of lambs and tigers.\u201d It is called meka puli aata in Telugu and aadu huli aata in Kannada. This is a two-player game where the tigers hunt goats on an asymmetric grid.\\n\\nIn this game, first, draw a triangle and divide it into three equal parts. Then, draw a rectangle on the entire triangle, intersecting it throughout. Then divide the rectangle horizontally into two parts. One player has 15 \u201cgoats,\u201d and the other player has three \u201ctigers.\u201d Each of these pieces is placed at the intersection point. Tigers try to eat goats, and goats try to actively stop them. The pieces are usually cowrie shells or pebbles.\\n\\n9. Chowkabara\\n\\nThis is another four-player game that is similar to Chaupar or Ludo. The goal of the game is to achieve home safety without getting removed by the opponents\u2019 pieces. The game is popular all over India and is known under different names, such as Eight and Four, Kattam Kalo, Chauka Baara, Changapoo, Ettu Veedu, Kattam Kazhi, and Aada Sada.\\n\\n10. Pancha kone\\n\\nPancha kone is a popular Indian traditional game. You can find this game\\n\\n\"}] | 3 |who plays jekyll in once upon a time|[\"informational\",\"simple\",\"arts and entertainment\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"research\",\"non-sensitive\"] |[{\"raw_text\": \"For the Enchanted Forest character, see Prince Henry.For the Land Without Magic character, see Henry Mills.For the Wish Realm character, see Henry (Wish Realm).Doctor Henry Jekyll, formerly known as the Groundsman, is a character on ABC's Once Upon a Time. He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.\\n\\nDr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.\\nHistory\\nDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father.\\n\\nJekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories.\\n\\nStill in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up.

The experiment would later attract the attention of Rumplestiltskin, who suddenly appears and helps Jekyll perfect the serum, and when Jekyll drinks it, he transforms into Hyde for the first time. That night at a party, Hyde, with the help of Rumplestiltskin, confronts Mary\u2019s father and threatens to expose the truth about him sleeping with his lab assistant if he doesn\u2019t grant Jekyll his membership into the academy.

After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering.

When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on.

The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty level, query intent, and other dimensions.UsageYou can easily load and use Geo-Bench in Python using the datasetslibrary:import datasets# Load Geo-Benchdataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"GEO-optim/geo-bench\")Data SourceGeo-Bench is a compilation of queries from various sources, both real and synthetically generated, to create a benchmark tailored for generative engines. The datasets used in constructing Geo-Bench are as follows:MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: These datasets contain real anonymized user queries from Bing and Google Search Engines, collectively representing common datasets used in search engine-related research.AIISouls: This dataset contains essay questions from \"All Souls College, Oxford University,\" challenging generative engines to perform reasoning and aggregate information from multiple sources.LIMA: Contains challenging questions requiring generative engines to not only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning to answer the question, such as writing short poems or generating Python code.Davinci-Debate: Contains debate questions generated for testing generative engines.Perplexity.ai Discover: These queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai's Discover section, an updated list of trending queries on the platform.EII-5: This dataset contains questions from the ELIS subreddit, where users ask complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman terms.GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query distribution, GPT-4 is prompted to generate queries ranging from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and difficulty levels (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).Apart from queries, we also provide 5 cleaned html responses based on top Google search results.TagsOptimizing website content often requires making targeted changes based on the domain of the task. Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature. To this end, we tag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For tagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall and precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated system, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered as the sole basis for filtering or analysis.Difficulty Level- The complexity of the query, ranging from simple to complex.- Example of a simple query: \"What is the capital of France?\"- Example of a complex query: \"What are the implications of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics?\"Nature of Query- The type of information sought by the query, such as factual, opinion, or comparison.- Example of a factual query: \"How does a car engine work?\"- Example of an opinion query: \"What is your opinion on the Harry Potter series?\"Genre- The category or domain of the query, such as arts and entertainment, finance, or science.- Example of a query in the arts and entertainment genre: \"Who won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020?\"- Example of a query in the finance genre: \"What is the current exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar?\"Specific Topics- The specific subject matter of the query, such as physics, economics, or computer science.- Example of a query on a specific topic in physics: \"What is the theory of relativity?\"- Example of a query on a specific topic in economics: \"What is the law of supply and demand?\"Sensitivity- Whether the query involves sensitive topics or not.- Example of a non-sensitive query: \"What is the tallest mountain in the world?\"- Example of a sensitive query: \"What is the current political situation in North Korea?\"User Intent- The purpose behind the user's query, such as research, purchase, or entertainment.- Example of a research intent query: \"What are the health benefits of a vegetarian diet?\"- Example of a purchase intent query: \"Where can I buy the latest iPhone?\"Answer Type- The format of the answer that the query is seeking, such as fact, opinion, or list.- Example of a fact answer type query: \"What is the population of New York City?\"- Example of an opinion answer type query: \"Is it better to buy or rent a house?\"Additional InformationGeo-Bench is intended for research purposes and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of content optimization for generative engines.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across stateYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deityFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.Members of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.However, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.Status: BannedOld Mysuru regionCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu HaisoduKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.The ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara,The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.Status: PractisedHubbaliRam Fight of Savji CommunitySomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.At present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.Status: Banned, illegally practisedHubbaliKobri Hori competitionKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.The bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.Status: Banned, illegally practisedMangaluru, UdupiCock fighting or kori katteAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.A special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.The event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from `20,000-`25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,\u201d said activist Ravi.According to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.Status: Banned, illegally practisedNorth KarnatakaBullock cart racingBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years. The event which was widely held across the state is now restricted to parts of north Karnataka. The races are held during Dasara and Diwali. Participants race in bullock carts and winners receive prize money.Status: No banUdupiBuffalo racing or kambalaKambala is an annual buffalo race organised by agrarian families after the harvest of Rabi crop. Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.In the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals. The game has become an organised rural sport with committees setting up schedules and cash prizes.The game is conducted across Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and even parts of Kasaragod in Kerala. However, the sport has been put on hold due to an interim ban by the High Court, following opposition by animal rights activists.Previously, despite a petition for a ban on the event by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA), the races were held with regulations issued by local district administration.status: Interim ban",

            "raw_source": "Traditional games have always been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. There are a variety of indoor, outdoor and board games that were popular in Karnataka. Many of these interesting games were played by both the young and the old.But with the advent of computers, mobile phones and play stations the concept of playing games have drastically changed in the state along with the rest of the country. Though a few of the traditional games are still played in Karnataka, people dwelling in the cities have lost touch with most of the traditional games.Let us take a look at some of the traditional games that were once enthusiastically played across Karnataka.Chinni Dandu (Gilli Danda)Gilli danda is one of the most popular outdoor games played all over India and even in South Asia. It is called Chinni Dandu in Kannada. This game is believed to be the origin of many European and American games such as Cricket, Baseball and Softball. The game is played with a peg (gilli) and a stick (danda), both of which are made of wood. The stick is used to strike the peg. It is a team game that requires hand eye co-ordination and concentration of the player.Buguri (Spinning the top)Spinning the top or Lattu is a fun game played across many parts of India and Pakistan. It is known as Buguri in Kannada. It is an interesting traditional game where a wooden top is made to spin. There are grooves in the lower half of the top and a nail at the bottom to spin on. A string is wrapped around the grooves to deploy the top and make it spin.Goti (Marbles)Popularly known as marbles, kancha or goli, it is a much loved gully sport in the country. It is called Goti in Kannada. This classic game requires the player to hit the selected target \u2018marble\u2019 using his/her own marble ball. The winner of the game walks away with all the marbles of the other players. This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.KabaddiKabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka. It requires the participants to lift round stone balls (called kallu gundu in Kannada) of various sizes and weights. The sport demands that the players be physically strong enough to lift heavy stones.PagadePagade is a cross and circle board game that is very similar to the ancient game of Pachisi or Chaupad. This game requires 2 or 4 players to race their respective pawns to reach the innermost square. The origin of the game can be traced to 4th century AD and it has remained popular throughout history.Chowka Bara (Chakaara)Chauka Bara is one of the oldest board games of India that is still played in some parts of the country. It is known as Chowka Bara in Mysuru and as Chakaara or Chakka in north Karnataka. This game is similar to ludo and can be played by 4 players. It is a game of chance that is played with cowry shells (called kavade in Kannada). The players attempt to race their pawns from the starting point to the safety of home. The game improves eye-to-eye coordination and teaches to make strategies.AshtapadaAshtapada is an Indian board game that originated before chess. The game is played on a board having eight-by-eight grid of squares of same colour and the board has special markings known as \u201ccastles\u201d. Each player has an even number of game pieces and the objective is to move a game piece around the board in clockwise direction, enter the castle, and regain the castle back in a counter-clockwise direction so as to make the game piece reach the center. It can be played by 2 or 4 players.Paramapada (Snakes & Ladders)Snakes & Ladders is a classic board game that originated in ancient India. It is known as Paramapada in Kannada. The game can be played by two or more players on a game-board that has numbered, gridded squares. The board has several ladders and snakes drawn on it. Players have to navigate their game piece from the start to the finish based on die rolls. The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.Ali Guli ManeAli Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.Lagori (Seven Stones)A stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.Adu Huli Aata (Tiger & Goat)Tiger and goat is a hunt game that is known as Adu Huli Aata in Kannada. The game is played between 2 players where one player gets 3 tigers and the other player has 15 goats. The game is about the tigers trying to kill the goats while the goats look for ways to immobilize the tigers. This game requires planning and concentration on part of both the players.Saalu Mane Ata (Nine Men\u2019s Morris)Nine Men\u2019s Morris is a traditional board game that originated in the western world. It is known as Saalu Mane Ata or Jodpi Ata or Char-Par in Kannada and is popular as Navakankari in various parts of India. This alignment game requires 2 players. Each player is given 9 coins and they try to achieve as many points as possible by getting 3 coins in a row on the game board. It is a complex game that requires strategic thinking.Kunte Bille (Hopscotch)Hopscotch is a traditional children\u2019s game that is known as Kunte Bille in Kannada. The game can be played alone or with several players. It involves drawing a court on the ground and then tossing a small object into the numbered rectangles of the court. The player then needs to hop or jump through the spaces in order to retrieve the object.Kambala (Buffalo Race)Kambala or Buffalo Race is a rural sport of Karnataka. This traditional sport involves farmers racing the buffaloes through tracks are ploughed into a muddy field that is made slushy with water. The sport is a source of much enjoyment for the rural folks of the state.Hagga Jaggata (Tug of War)Tug of war or rope pulling is an age-old sport that is known as Hagga Jaggata in Kannada. The sport involves two teams who pull on opposite ends of a rope in a test of strength. The objective is to pull the rope by both teams at opposite ends until one team drags the other over a central line.Naaku Kallu Aata (Four Stone)Four stone is an ancient traditional game that is known as Naaku Kallu Aata in Karnataka. It requires four independent boxes to be drawn on the ground. One player each stands in the four boxes and tries to take the four stones placed at the centre without being caught by the chaser in the game.Hand WrestlingHand wrestling is enthusiastically played by the folks of rural Karnataka. The game is played with hands where one player has to hold with both hand and fingers his opponent\u2019s hand under the wrist joint very tightly. The objective of the game is to prevent the opponent from freeing his hand from the player\u2019s clutches. Then the player must free his own hand from the opponent\u2019s clutch when his turn comes.These are just a few of the exciting traditional games that were once an integral part of Karnataka\u2019s heritage. There are several other games that have been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. But most of these games are on the verge of being erased from people\u2019s memory these days. These traditional games can be enjoyed even today. Several of these games are quite interesting to play and can help to keep children away from the clutches of electronic games they constantly play on computers and mobiles.Also see,",

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.\\n\\nDr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.\\nHistory\\nDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father.\\n\\nJekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories.\\n\\nStill in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner.\\n\\nWhen the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde.\\n\\nAt the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with.\\n\\nJekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece.\\n\\n\"},{\"raw_text\": \"For the Enchanted Forest character, see Prince Henry.For the Land Without Magic character, see Henry Mills.For the Wish Realm character, see Henry (Wish Realm).Doctor Henry Jekyll, formerly known as the Groundsman, is a character on ABC's Once Upon a Time.

The Storybrooke events take place after \\\"The Other Shoe\\\".In the Characters' Past[edit]In Victorian England, Dr. Jekyll is joined by his friend Mary Lydgate, whose father, Dr. Lydgate, is a member of a prestigious science academy, as he hopes to convince him to back his project that he created, a serum that separates personalities, only to be rejected. The experiment would later attract the attention of Rumplestiltskin, who suddenly appears and helps Jekyll perfect the serum, and when Jekyll drinks it, he transforms into Hyde for the first time. That night at a party, Hyde, with the help of Rumplestiltskin, confronts Mary\u2019s father and threatens to expose the truth about him sleeping with his lab assistant if he doesn\u2019t grant Jekyll his membership into the academy. In the morning, Jekyll wakes up and remembers nothing but finds himself to be an academy member.Later on, Rumplestiltskin influences Jekyll to become Hyde again, this time to win over Mary, revealing that Jekyll has strong feelings for her, but she admits that she isn\u2019t interested in the same way and wants a man who wants to embrace passion without getting rid of it, and the two kiss. The following morning, Jekyll and Mary are waking up in bed together and are shocked by the outcome, as Jekyll tries to convince her that he is Hyde, but Mary is upset that Jekyll tricked her and tries to run away, prompting an angry Jekyll to push Mary out of the window and to her death. Realizing what he has done, Jekyll drinks the last of the serum and escapes as Hyde.In Storybrooke[edit]At the Pawn shop, Gold is looking in the mirror and sees his hair as he prepares to cut it, giving him a more crew cut appearance. He is soon visited by the Evil Queen and Hyde, who demanded a necklace. As Gold choked Hyde, he learned that he cannot be killed by The Evil Queen, although she tells Gold that their deal to protect Belle and the baby is still in effect. When news leaks of Hyde escaping the hospital, this suddenly disrupts the normally for David and Snow, as well as for Emma and Hook, who is ready to move in with her. When Regina and Jekyll shows off the necklace, they soon discover that the serum will be vital in defeating The Evil Queen and Hyde. With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering. Later on, Regina asks Gold for help, only to discover the Evil Queen and Hyde have already destroyed the lab but Jekyll managed to save a tiny bit of the serum which Regina wants to use on the Evil Queen. Gold to steals Jekyll\u2019s heart to convince Regina to hand over the serum which he then pours the serum onto his dagger which will be useful in killing Hyde. As Gold leaves, he tosses Jekyll\u2019s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.In the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, and this time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he switched serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One\u2019s dagger and uses it to control Gold to take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to \\\"do what is necessary\\\" to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of \\\"weakness,\\\" but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that \u201cnecessity\u201d will make her love him once again.Back at Storybrooke Elementary School, Snow resumes her role as teacher, and introduces her new assistant Shirin to the class. Realizing that the students are struggling, Shirin suggests that Snow embrace her past to inspire them. Taking a cue from Isaac Newton, Snow uses her experience as an archer and the students are in awe, winning her confidence with them. At the end of the school day, Shirin later meets up with the Oracle, where they are coordinating plans to search for Aladdin, as Shirin is revealed to be Princess Jasmine.Production[edit]- Rebecca Mader, who was credited in this episode, was not featured.- The episode features Jonny Coyne as Dr. Lydgate, reprising the role he originated in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, thus establishing Jekyll and Hyde's \\\"Victorian England\\\" as the same \\\"realm of story\\\" that was featured on that show.- The reason why Gold cuts his hair is because, during the break between the fifth and sixth seasons, Robert Carlyle had filmed Trainspotting 2 which required his hair to be shortened (Carlyle having worn a wig for the season's previous episodes).Reception[edit]Ratings[edit]The episode saw a drop from the previous outing, posting a 1.1/4 rating among 18-49s with 3.48 million tuning in.[1]Reviews[edit]- Justin Kirkland of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+.[2]- The AV Club gave out pointers on the episode, giving positive points on Jekyll and Hyde's backstory and twist, but were mixed on the premise and scenes.[3]- Christine Laskodi of TV Fantic gave the episode a good review: 4.0 out of 5.0[4]References[edit]- ^ \\\"TV Ratings Sunday: \u2018Simpsons\u2019 600th episode scores, \u2018Quantico\u2019 hits series low on mostly down night\\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (October 17, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time premiere recap: Strange Case'\\\" from Entertainment Weekly (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Jekyll and Hyde\u2019s \u201cStrange Case\u201d on Once Upon A Time melds good with evil\\\" from AV Club (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time Review: Strange Case\\\" from TV Fanatic (October 16, 2016)\",\"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case\",\"cleaned_text\": \"\\\"Strange Case\\\" is the fourth episode of the sixth season of the American fantasy drama series Once Upon a Time, which aired on October 16, 2016.

It consists of 10,000 queries sourced from multiple real-world and synthetically generated queries, specifically curated and repurposed for generative engines. The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty level, query intent, and other dimensions.UsageYou can easily load and use Geo-Bench in Python using the datasetslibrary:import datasets# Load Geo-Benchdataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"GEO-optim/geo-bench\")Data SourceGeo-Bench is a compilation of queries from various sources, both real and synthetically generated, to create a benchmark tailored for generative engines. The datasets used in constructing Geo-Bench are as follows:MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: These datasets contain real anonymized user queries from Bing and Google Search Engines, collectively representing common datasets used in search engine-related research.AIISouls: This dataset contains essay questions from \"All Souls College, Oxford University,\" challenging generative engines to perform reasoning and aggregate information from multiple sources.LIMA: Contains challenging questions requiring generative engines to not only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning to answer the question, such as writing short poems or generating Python code.Davinci-Debate: Contains debate questions generated for testing generative engines.Perplexity.ai Discover: These queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai's Discover section, an updated list of trending queries on the platform.EII-5: This dataset contains questions from the ELIS subreddit, where users ask complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman terms.GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query distribution, GPT-4 is prompted to generate queries ranging from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and difficulty levels (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).Apart from queries, we also provide 5 cleaned html responses based on top Google search results.TagsOptimizing website content often requires making targeted changes based on the domain of the task. Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature. To this end, we tag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For tagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall and precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated system, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered as the sole basis for filtering or analysis.Difficulty Level- The complexity of the query, ranging from simple to complex.- Example of a simple query: \"What is the capital of France?\"- Example of a complex query: \"What are the implications of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics?\"Nature of Query- The type of information sought by the query, such as factual, opinion, or comparison.- Example of a factual query: \"How does a car engine work?\"- Example of an opinion query: \"What is your opinion on the Harry Potter series?\"Genre- The category or domain of the query, such as arts and entertainment, finance, or science.- Example of a query in the arts and entertainment genre: \"Who won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020?\"- Example of a query in the finance genre: \"What is the current exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar?\"Specific Topics- The specific subject matter of the query, such as physics, economics, or computer science.- Example of a query on a specific topic in physics: \"What is the theory of relativity?\"- Example of a query on a specific topic in economics: \"What is the law of supply and demand?\"Sensitivity- Whether the query involves sensitive topics or not.- Example of a non-sensitive query: \"What is the tallest mountain in the world?\"- Example of a sensitive query: \"What is the current political situation in North Korea?\"User Intent- The purpose behind the user's query, such as research, purchase, or entertainment.- Example of a research intent query: \"What are the health benefits of a vegetarian diet?\"- Example of a purchase intent query: \"Where can I buy the latest iPhone?\"Answer Type- The format of the answer that the query is seeking, such as fact, opinion, or list.- Example of a fact answer type query: \"What is the population of New York City?\"- Example of an opinion answer type query: \"Is it better to buy or rent a house?\"Additional InformationGeo-Bench is intended for research purposes and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of content optimization for generative engines.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across stateYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deityFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.Members of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.However, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.Status: BannedOld Mysuru regionCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu HaisoduKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.The ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara,The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.Status: PractisedHubbaliRam Fight of Savji CommunitySomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.At present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.Status: Banned, illegally practisedHubbaliKobri Hori competitionKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.The bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.Status: Banned, illegally practisedMangaluru, UdupiCock fighting or kori katteAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.A special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.The event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from `20,000-`25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,\u201d said activist Ravi.According to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.Status: Banned, illegally practisedNorth KarnatakaBullock cart racingBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years. The event which was widely held across the state is now restricted to parts of north Karnataka. The races are held during Dasara and Diwali. Participants race in bullock carts and winners receive prize money.Status: No banUdupiBuffalo racing or kambalaKambala is an annual buffalo race organised by agrarian families after the harvest of Rabi crop. Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.In the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals.

            "raw_source": "Traditional games have always been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. There are a variety of indoor, outdoor and board games that were popular in Karnataka. Many of these interesting games were played by both the young and the old.But with the advent of computers, mobile phones and play stations the concept of playing games have drastically changed in the state along with the rest of the country. Though a few of the traditional games are still played in Karnataka, people dwelling in the cities have lost touch with most of the traditional games.Let us take a look at some of the traditional games that were once enthusiastically played across Karnataka.Chinni Dandu (Gilli Danda)Gilli danda is one of the most popular outdoor games played all over India and even in South Asia. It is called Chinni Dandu in Kannada. This game is believed to be the origin of many European and American games such as Cricket, Baseball and Softball.

A string is wrapped around the grooves to deploy the top and make it spin.Goti (Marbles)Popularly known as marbles, kancha or goli, it is a much loved gully sport in the country. It is called Goti in Kannada. This classic game requires the player to hit the selected target \u2018marble\u2019 using his/her own marble ball. The winner of the game walks away with all the marbles of the other players. This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.KabaddiKabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka. It requires the participants to lift round stone balls (called kallu gundu in Kannada) of various sizes and weights.

The game is played on a board having eight-by-eight grid of squares of same colour and the board has special markings known as \u201ccastles\u201d.

It can be played by 2 or 4 players.Paramapada (Snakes & Ladders)Snakes & Ladders is a classic board game that originated in ancient India. It is known as Paramapada in Kannada. The game can be played by two or more players on a game-board that has numbered, gridded squares. The board has several ladders and snakes drawn on it. Players have to navigate their game piece from the start to the finish based on die rolls. The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.Ali Guli ManeAli Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.Lagori (Seven Stones)A stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.Adu Huli Aata (Tiger & Goat)Tiger and goat is a hunt game that is known as Adu Huli Aata in Kannada.

It requires four independent boxes to be drawn on the ground. One player each stands in the four boxes and tries to take the four stones placed at the centre without being caught by the chaser in the game.Hand WrestlingHand wrestling is enthusiastically played by the folks of rural Karnataka. The game is played with hands where one player has to hold with both hand and fingers his opponent\u2019s hand under the wrist joint very tightly.

Pachisi was traditionally played on a symmetrical cross cloth. On the other hand, Chaupar was a board game invented in the 4th century.\\n\\nIn both these games, two to four players use cowrie shells and dice to plan their maneuvers and attack opponents. Now, you call this game Ludo, one of the more popular games today. Pachisi or Chaupar is an excellent game to teach your child how to plan and execute.\\n\\n2. Anchankal/Kallankal\\n\\nThis game is widely played in Tamil Nadu. As the name of the game suggests, Anchankal is a game composed of five stones. The game improves hand-eye coordination, concentration, memory, and aiming abilities. This is a very engaging game, and the best part is that you can create your own steps.\\n\\nIn the original game, you use five smooth stones that can be held in your hand. Place the stones on the floor or any flat surface. Pick one stone, toss it in the air, and while that stone is in the air, pick another stone from the ground, while catching the stone tossed in the air before it hits the ground. Repeat this with the rest of the stones.\\n\\nYou can continue this game by picking up different numbers of stones from the floor, or even throwing a different number of stones into the air, and then picking up other stones before other stones fall. It is important that you should not let the stones tossed in the air fall on the ground. It requires some practice, but once you master it, you can enjoy hours of entertainment.\\n\\n3. Ashtapada\\n\\nAshtapada is the predecessor of chess. Just like a chessboard, the Ashtapada board is also divided into an 8\u00d78 square grids but of one color. Ashtapada is a dice game. There are markings on the corners and the center square of the board. These squares are called castles. The pieces on these squares are safe, captured, or removed by the opponents.\\n\\nEach player starts with an even number of pieces to play the game. The pieces must be moved clockwise around the board to enter the castle on the outer edge. Then they enter the castle in the center in a clockwise direction. This is a game to reach the castle.\\n\\nAnother variation of Ashtapada is Dasapada that is played on a 10\u00d710 board.\\n4. Chaturanga\\n\\nChaturanga is an ancient strategy game invented in India. It is believed to be the ancestor of strategy games, such as Chess, Xiangqi, Shogi, and Makruk. Chaturanga is mentioned in many ancient scripts. It is played on the Ashtapada board. There are two players.\\n\\nJust like modern chess, Chaturanga has various pieces \u2014 the King (Raja), General (Mantri or Senapati), Rook (Ratha), Elephant/Bishop (Gaja), Horse/Knight (Ashva), and Pawn (Padaati or Bhata). Each piece moves in a certain direction.\\n\\nThe ultimate goal is to get the opponent\u2019s king into trouble so that he cannot move without being taken by the enemy. Kings and generals played this game to gain new ideas about the form of war offensive.\\n\\n5. Pallankuzhi\\n\\nIt is believed that this ancient game originated in Tamil Nadu but later spread to other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka. This game gained popularity even in Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The game is still played in some rural parts of India and is called Kuzhipara, Ali Guli Mane, or Picchala Peeta in different languages.\\n\\nIn this game, we use a rectangular board that is divided into two rows and seven cups. Players must use 146 counters to put in these cups. These counters are usually cowrie shells or tamarind shells. Each cup contains 12 counters. In the middle row cups, only two counters are placed. There are two players taking turns.\\n\\nThe starting player picks the counters from any of the holes on their side and assigns a counter to each cup in a counterclockwise direction. Once they reach the end of their cups, they move on to their opponent\u2019s cups. When their counters are over, they pick the counters from the next cup and continue the game. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the next cup are captured by the player. The next player takes over.\\n\\nThe game continues until the last counter falls in a cup with two empty cups beyond it. The player can capture no more counters, and their turn is over.\\n\\nIn this intricate game, there are other rules that make it interesting. Although this game is best played between two players, even one person can play the game on a lazy afternoon. Pallankuzhi can be played by both children and adults.\\n\\n6. Antakshari\\n\\nAntakshari is one of the most popular traditional Indian games. The game is played widely in social gatherings and weddings. Children play it in their free time at school. The best thing about this game is that it can also be played in a small space, just like when traveling in a car.\\n\\nAntakshari is the best way to spend time. You need to have a repertoire of songs to play this game. You can play this game in a team. Each team sings in turns, starting from the last letter of the previous song sung by the other team.\\n\\n7. Moksha Patam\\n\\nMoksha Patam or Parama Padam is a board game that is believed to have been invented in ancient India and has spread to other parts of the world. Now, it is commonly called Snakes and Ladders. In ancient India, it was used as a form of entertainment and to teach morality to children.\\n\\nThe basic concept is to teach people that the way to reach heaven or \u201cmoksha\u201d is to abandon the bondage of passion. The ladder symbolizes the rise from one level of enlightenment to another, while the snake symbolizes immoral behavior and how they lead to degeneration. This game is played by two to four players. The first player to reach the \u201chighest heaven\u201d is the winner.\\n\\n8. Aadu puli aatam\\n\\nAadu puli aatam literally means \u201ca game of lambs and tigers.\u201d It is called meka puli aata in Telugu and aadu huli aata in Kannada. This is a two-player game where the tigers hunt goats on an asymmetric grid.\\n\\nIn this game, first, draw a triangle and divide it into three equal parts. Then, draw a rectangle on the entire triangle, intersecting it throughout. Then divide the rectangle horizontally into two parts. One player has 15 \u201cgoats,\u201d and the other player has three \u201ctigers.\u201d Each of these pieces is placed at the intersection point. Tigers try to eat goats, and goats try to actively stop them. The pieces are usually cowrie shells or pebbles.\\n\\n9. Chowkabara\\n\\nThis is another four-player game that is similar to Chaupar or Ludo. The goal of the game is to achieve home safety without getting removed by the opponents\u2019 pieces. The game is popular all over India and is known under different names, such as Eight and Four, Kattam Kalo, Chauka Baara, Changapoo, Ettu Veedu, Kattam Kazhi, and Aada Sada.\\n\\n10. Pancha kone\\n\\nPancha kone is a popular Indian traditional game. You can find this game\\n\\n\"}] | 3 |who plays jekyll in once upon a time|[\"informational\",\"simple\",\"arts and entertainment\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"research\",\"non-sensitive\"] |[{\"raw_text\": \"For the Enchanted Forest character, see Prince Henry.For the Land Without Magic character, see Henry Mills.For the Wish Realm character, see Henry (Wish Realm).Doctor Henry Jekyll, formerly known as the Groundsman, is a character on ABC's Once Upon a Time. He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

(\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.\\n\\nDr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.\\nHistory\\nDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father.\\n\\nJekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories.\\n\\nStill in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner.\\n\\nWhen the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde.\\n\\nAt the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with.\\n\\nJekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch.

The Storybrooke events take place after \\\"The Other Shoe\\\".In the Characters' Past[edit]In Victorian England, Dr. Jekyll is joined by his friend Mary Lydgate, whose father, Dr. Lydgate, is a member of a prestigious science academy, as he hopes to convince him to back his project that he created, a serum that separates personalities, only to be rejected. The experiment would later attract the attention of Rumplestiltskin, who suddenly appears and helps Jekyll perfect the serum, and when Jekyll drinks it, he transforms into Hyde for the first time. That night at a party, Hyde, with the help of Rumplestiltskin, confronts Mary\u2019s father and threatens to expose the truth about him sleeping with his lab assistant if he doesn\u2019t grant Jekyll his membership into the academy. In the morning, Jekyll wakes up and remembers nothing but finds himself to be an academy member.Later on, Rumplestiltskin influences Jekyll to become Hyde again, this time to win over Mary, revealing that Jekyll has strong feelings for her, but she admits that she isn\u2019t interested in the same way and wants a man who wants to embrace passion without getting rid of it, and the two kiss.

With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering.

When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde.

Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature. To this end, we tag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For tagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall and precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated system, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered as the sole basis for filtering or analysis.Difficulty Level- The complexity of the query, ranging from simple to complex.- Example of a simple query: \"What is the capital of France?\"- Example of a complex query: \"What are the implications of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics?\"Nature of Query- The type of information sought by the query, such as factual, opinion, or comparison.- Example of a factual query: \"How does a car engine work?\"- Example of an opinion query: \"What is your opinion on the Harry Potter series?\"Genre- The category or domain of the query, such as arts and entertainment, finance, or science.- Example of a query in the arts and entertainment genre: \"Who won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020?\"- Example of a query in the finance genre: \"What is the current exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar?\"Specific Topics- The specific subject matter of the query, such as physics, economics, or computer science.- Example of a query on a specific topic in physics: \"What is the theory of relativity?\"- Example of a query on a specific topic in economics: \"What is the law of supply and demand?\"Sensitivity- Whether the query involves sensitive topics or not.- Example of a non-sensitive query: \"What is the tallest mountain in the world?\"- Example of a sensitive query: \"What is the current political situation in North Korea?\"User Intent- The purpose behind the user's query, such as research, purchase, or entertainment.- Example of a research intent query: \"What are the health benefits of a vegetarian diet?\"- Example of a purchase intent query: \"Where can I buy the latest iPhone?\"Answer Type- The format of the answer that the query is seeking, such as fact, opinion, or list.- Example of a fact answer type query: \"What is the population of New York City?\"- Example of an opinion answer type query: \"Is it better to buy or rent a house?\"Additional InformationGeo-Bench is intended for research purposes and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of content optimization for generative engines.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across stateYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deityFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.Members of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.However, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.Status: BannedOld Mysuru regionCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu HaisoduKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.The ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara,The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.Status: PractisedHubbaliRam Fight of Savji CommunitySomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.At present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.Status: Banned, illegally practisedHubbaliKobri Hori competitionKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.The bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.Status: Banned, illegally practisedMangaluru, UdupiCock fighting or kori katteAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.A special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.The event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from `20,000-`25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,\u201d said activist Ravi.According to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.Status: Banned, illegally practisedNorth KarnatakaBullock cart racingBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years. The event which was widely held across the state is now restricted to parts of north Karnataka. The races are held during Dasara and Diwali. Participants race in bullock carts and winners receive prize money.Status: No banUdupiBuffalo racing or kambalaKambala is an annual buffalo race organised by agrarian families after the harvest of Rabi crop. Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.In the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals. The game has become an organised rural sport with committees setting up schedules and cash prizes.The game is conducted across Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and even parts of Kasaragod in Kerala. However, the sport has been put on hold due to an interim ban by the High Court, following opposition by animal rights activists.Previously, despite a petition for a ban on the event by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA), the races were held with regulations issued by local district administration.status: Interim ban",

            "raw_source": "Traditional games have always been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. There are a variety of indoor, outdoor and board games that were popular in Karnataka. Many of these interesting games were played by both the young and the old.But with the advent of computers, mobile phones and play stations the concept of playing games have drastically changed in the state along with the rest of the country. Though a few of the traditional games are still played in Karnataka, people dwelling in the cities have lost touch with most of the traditional games.Let us take a look at some of the traditional games that were once enthusiastically played across Karnataka.Chinni Dandu (Gilli Danda)Gilli danda is one of the most popular outdoor games played all over India and even in South Asia. It is called Chinni Dandu in Kannada. This game is believed to be the origin of many European and American games such as Cricket, Baseball and Softball. The game is played with a peg (gilli) and a stick (danda), both of which are made of wood. The stick is used to strike the peg. It is a team game that requires hand eye co-ordination and concentration of the player.Buguri (Spinning the top)Spinning the top or Lattu is a fun game played across many parts of India and Pakistan. It is known as Buguri in Kannada. It is an interesting traditional game where a wooden top is made to spin. There are grooves in the lower half of the top and a nail at the bottom to spin on. A string is wrapped around the grooves to deploy the top and make it spin.Goti (Marbles)Popularly known as marbles, kancha or goli, it is a much loved gully sport in the country. It is called Goti in Kannada. This classic game requires the player to hit the selected target \u2018marble\u2019 using his/her own marble ball. The winner of the game walks away with all the marbles of the other players. This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.KabaddiKabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka. It requires the participants to lift round stone balls (called kallu gundu in Kannada) of various sizes and weights. The sport demands that the players be physically strong enough to lift heavy stones.PagadePagade is a cross and circle board game that is very similar to the ancient game of Pachisi or Chaupad. This game requires 2 or 4 players to race their respective pawns to reach the innermost square. The origin of the game can be traced to 4th century AD and it has remained popular throughout history.Chowka Bara (Chakaara)Chauka Bara is one of the oldest board games of India that is still played in some parts of the country. It is known as Chowka Bara in Mysuru and as Chakaara or Chakka in north Karnataka. This game is similar to ludo and can be played by 4 players. It is a game of chance that is played with cowry shells (called kavade in Kannada). The players attempt to race their pawns from the starting point to the safety of home. The game improves eye-to-eye coordination and teaches to make strategies.AshtapadaAshtapada is an Indian board game that originated before chess. The game is played on a board having eight-by-eight grid of squares of same colour and the board has special markings known as \u201ccastles\u201d. Each player has an even number of game pieces and the objective is to move a game piece around the board in clockwise direction, enter the castle, and regain the castle back in a counter-clockwise direction so as to make the game piece reach the center. It can be played by 2 or 4 players.Paramapada (Snakes & Ladders)Snakes & Ladders is a classic board game that originated in ancient India. It is known as Paramapada in Kannada. The game can be played by two or more players on a game-board that has numbered, gridded squares. The board has several ladders and snakes drawn on it. Players have to navigate their game piece from the start to the finish based on die rolls. The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.Ali Guli ManeAli Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.Lagori (Seven Stones)A stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.Adu Huli Aata (Tiger & Goat)Tiger and goat is a hunt game that is known as Adu Huli Aata in Kannada. The game is played between 2 players where one player gets 3 tigers and the other player has 15 goats. The game is about the tigers trying to kill the goats while the goats look for ways to immobilize the tigers. This game requires planning and concentration on part of both the players.Saalu Mane Ata (Nine Men\u2019s Morris)Nine Men\u2019s Morris is a traditional board game that originated in the western world. It is known as Saalu Mane Ata or Jodpi Ata or Char-Par in Kannada and is popular as Navakankari in various parts of India. This alignment game requires 2 players. Each player is given 9 coins and they try to achieve as many points as possible by getting 3 coins in a row on the game board. It is a complex game that requires strategic thinking.Kunte Bille (Hopscotch)Hopscotch is a traditional children\u2019s game that is known as Kunte Bille in Kannada. The game can be played alone or with several players. It involves drawing a court on the ground and then tossing a small object into the numbered rectangles of the court. The player then needs to hop or jump through the spaces in order to retrieve the object.Kambala (Buffalo Race)Kambala or Buffalo Race is a rural sport of Karnataka. This traditional sport involves farmers racing the buffaloes through tracks are ploughed into a muddy field that is made slushy with water. The sport is a source of much enjoyment for the rural folks of the state.Hagga Jaggata (Tug of War)Tug of war or rope pulling is an age-old sport that is known as Hagga Jaggata in Kannada. The sport involves two teams who pull on opposite ends of a rope in a test of strength. The objective is to pull the rope by both teams at opposite ends until one team drags the other over a central line.Naaku Kallu Aata (Four Stone)Four stone is an ancient traditional game that is known as Naaku Kallu Aata in Karnataka. It requires four independent boxes to be drawn on the ground. One player each stands in the four boxes and tries to take the four stones placed at the centre without being caught by the chaser in the game.Hand WrestlingHand wrestling is enthusiastically played by the folks of rural Karnataka. The game is played with hands where one player has to hold with both hand and fingers his opponent\u2019s hand under the wrist joint very tightly. The objective of the game is to prevent the opponent from freeing his hand from the player\u2019s clutches. Then the player must free his own hand from the opponent\u2019s clutch when his turn comes.These are just a few of the exciting traditional games that were once an integral part of Karnataka\u2019s heritage. There are several other games that have been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. But most of these games are on the verge of being erased from people\u2019s memory these days. These traditional games can be enjoyed even today. Several of these games are quite interesting to play and can help to keep children away from the clutches of electronic games they constantly play on computers and mobiles.Also see,",

There are a variety of indoor, outdoor and board games that were popular in Karnataka. Many of these interesting games were played by both the young and the old.But with the advent of computers, mobile phones and play stations the concept of playing games have drastically changed in the state along with the rest of the country. Though a few of the traditional games are still played in Karnataka, people dwelling in the cities have lost touch with most of the traditional games.Let us take a look at some of the traditional games that were once enthusiastically played across Karnataka.Chinni Dandu (Gilli Danda)Gilli danda is one of the most popular outdoor games played all over India and even in South Asia. It is called Chinni Dandu in Kannada. This game is believed to be the origin of many European and American games such as Cricket, Baseball and Softball. The game is played with a peg (gilli) and a stick (danda), both of which are made of wood. The stick is used to strike the peg. It is a team game that requires hand eye co-ordination and concentration of the player.Buguri (Spinning the top)Spinning the top or Lattu is a fun game played across many parts of India and Pakistan. It is known as Buguri in Kannada. It is an interesting traditional game where a wooden top is made to spin. There are grooves in the lower half of the top and a nail at the bottom to spin on. A string is wrapped around the grooves to deploy the top and make it spin.Goti (Marbles)Popularly known as marbles, kancha or goli, it is a much loved gully sport in the country. It is called Goti in Kannada. This classic game requires the player to hit the selected target \u2018marble\u2019 using his/her own marble ball. The winner of the game walks away with all the marbles of the other players. This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.KabaddiKabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka. It requires the participants to lift round stone balls (called kallu gundu in Kannada) of various sizes and weights. The sport demands that the players be physically strong enough to lift heavy stones.PagadePagade is a cross and circle board game that is very similar to the ancient game of Pachisi or Chaupad. This game requires 2 or 4 players to race their respective pawns to reach the innermost square. The origin of the game can be traced to 4th century AD and it has remained popular throughout history.Chowka Bara (Chakaara)Chauka Bara is one of the oldest board games of India that is still played in some parts of the country. It is known as Chowka Bara in Mysuru and as Chakaara or Chakka in north Karnataka. This game is similar to ludo and can be played by 4 players. It is a game of chance that is played with cowry shells (called kavade in Kannada). The players attempt to race their pawns from the starting point to the safety of home. The game improves eye-to-eye coordination and teaches to make strategies.AshtapadaAshtapada is an Indian board game that originated before chess. The game is played on a board having eight-by-eight grid of squares of same colour and the board has special markings known as \u201ccastles\u201d. Each player has an even number of game pieces and the objective is to move a game piece around the board in clockwise direction, enter the castle, and regain the castle back in a counter-clockwise direction so as to make the game piece reach the center. It can be played by 2 or 4 players.Paramapada (Snakes & Ladders)Snakes & Ladders is a classic board game that originated in ancient India. It is known as Paramapada in Kannada. The game can be played by two or more players on a game-board that has numbered, gridded squares. The board has several ladders and snakes drawn on it. Players have to navigate their game piece from the start to the finish based on die rolls. The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.Ali Guli ManeAli Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.Lagori (Seven Stones)A stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.Adu Huli Aata (Tiger & Goat)Tiger and goat is a hunt game that is known as Adu Huli Aata in Kannada.

The game improves hand-eye coordination, concentration, memory, and aiming abilities. This is a very engaging game, and the best part is that you can create your own steps.In the original game, you use five smooth stones that can be held in your hand. Place the stones on the floor or any flat surface. Pick one stone, toss it in the air, and while that stone is in the air, pick another stone from the ground, while catching the stone tossed in the air before it hits the ground. Repeat this with the rest of the stones.You can continue this game by picking up different numbers of stones from the floor, or even throwing a different number of stones into the air, and then picking up other stones before other stones fall.

If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the next cup are captured by the player.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs.

Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit.

Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde.\\n\\nAt the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with.\\n\\nJekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece.\\n\\n\"},{\"raw_text\": \"On the Season 6 premiere episode of Once Upon a Time, \u2018The Savior,\u2019 while refugees from the Land of Untold Stories invade Storybrooke and in a flashback Jafar (Oded Fehr) confronts Aladdin (Deniz Akdeniz), Emma (Jennifer Morrison) and the heroes try to stop Mr. Hyde which won\u2019t be easy.

The Storybrooke events take place after \\\"The Other Shoe\\\".In the Characters' Past[edit]In Victorian England, Dr. Jekyll is joined by his friend Mary Lydgate, whose father, Dr. Lydgate, is a member of a prestigious science academy, as he hopes to convince him to back his project that he created, a serum that separates personalities, only to be rejected. The experiment would later attract the attention of Rumplestiltskin, who suddenly appears and helps Jekyll perfect the serum, and when Jekyll drinks it, he transforms into Hyde for the first time. That night at a party, Hyde, with the help of Rumplestiltskin, confronts Mary\u2019s father and threatens to expose the truth about him sleeping with his lab assistant if he doesn\u2019t grant Jekyll his membership into the academy. In the morning, Jekyll wakes up and remembers nothing but finds himself to be an academy member.Later on, Rumplestiltskin influences Jekyll to become Hyde again, this time to win over Mary, revealing that Jekyll has strong feelings for her, but she admits that she isn\u2019t interested in the same way and wants a man who wants to embrace passion without getting rid of it, and the two kiss. The following morning, Jekyll and Mary are waking up in bed together and are shocked by the outcome, as Jekyll tries to convince her that he is Hyde, but Mary is upset that Jekyll tricked her and tries to run away, prompting an angry Jekyll to push Mary out of the window and to her death. Realizing what he has done, Jekyll drinks the last of the serum and escapes as Hyde.In Storybrooke[edit]At the Pawn shop, Gold is looking in the mirror and sees his hair as he prepares to cut it, giving him a more crew cut appearance. He is soon visited by the Evil Queen and Hyde, who demanded a necklace. As Gold choked Hyde, he learned that he cannot be killed by The Evil Queen, although she tells Gold that their deal to protect Belle and the baby is still in effect. When news leaks of Hyde escaping the hospital, this suddenly disrupts the normally for David and Snow, as well as for Emma and Hook, who is ready to move in with her. When Regina and Jekyll shows off the necklace, they soon discover that the serum will be vital in defeating The Evil Queen and Hyde. With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering. Later on, Regina asks Gold for help, only to discover the Evil Queen and Hyde have already destroyed the lab but Jekyll managed to save a tiny bit of the serum which Regina wants to use on the Evil Queen. Gold to steals Jekyll\u2019s heart to convince Regina to hand over the serum which he then pours the serum onto his dagger which will be useful in killing Hyde. As Gold leaves, he tosses Jekyll\u2019s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.In the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, and this time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he switched serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One\u2019s dagger and uses it to control Gold to take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to \\\"do what is necessary\\\" to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of \\\"weakness,\\\" but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that \u201cnecessity\u201d will make her love him once again.Back at Storybrooke Elementary School, Snow resumes her role as teacher, and introduces her new assistant Shirin to the class. Realizing that the students are struggling, Shirin suggests that Snow embrace her past to inspire them. Taking a cue from Isaac Newton, Snow uses her experience as an archer and the students are in awe, winning her confidence with them. At the end of the school day, Shirin later meets up with the Oracle, where they are coordinating plans to search for Aladdin, as Shirin is revealed to be Princess Jasmine.Production[edit]- Rebecca Mader, who was credited in this episode, was not featured.- The episode features Jonny Coyne as Dr. Lydgate, reprising the role he originated in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, thus establishing Jekyll and Hyde's \\\"Victorian England\\\" as the same \\\"realm of story\\\" that was featured on that show.- The reason why Gold cuts his hair is because, during the break between the fifth and sixth seasons, Robert Carlyle had filmed Trainspotting 2 which required his hair to be shortened (Carlyle having worn a wig for the season's previous episodes).Reception[edit]Ratings[edit]The episode saw a drop from the previous outing, posting a 1.1/4 rating among 18-49s with 3.48 million tuning in.[1]Reviews[edit]- Justin Kirkland of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+.[2]- The AV Club gave out pointers on the episode, giving positive points on Jekyll and Hyde's backstory and twist, but were mixed on the premise and scenes.[3]- Christine Laskodi of TV Fantic gave the episode a good review: 4.0 out of 5.0[4]References[edit]- ^ \\\"TV Ratings Sunday: \u2018Simpsons\u2019 600th episode scores, \u2018Quantico\u2019 hits series low on mostly down night\\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (October 17, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time premiere recap: Strange Case'\\\" from Entertainment Weekly (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Jekyll and Hyde\u2019s \u201cStrange Case\u201d on Once Upon A Time melds good with evil\\\" from AV Club (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time Review: Strange Case\\\" from TV Fanatic (October 16, 2016)\",\"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case\",\"cleaned_text\": \"\\\"Strange Case\\\" is the fourth episode of the sixth season of the American fantasy drama series Once Upon a Time, which aired on October 16, 2016.

It consists of 10,000 queries sourced from multiple real-world and synthetically generated queries, specifically curated and repurposed for generative engines. The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty level, query intent, and other dimensions.UsageYou can easily load and use Geo-Bench in Python using the datasetslibrary:import datasets# Load Geo-Benchdataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"GEO-optim/geo-bench\")Data SourceGeo-Bench is a compilation of queries from various sources, both real and synthetically generated, to create a benchmark tailored for generative engines. The datasets used in constructing Geo-Bench are as follows:MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: These datasets contain real anonymized user queries from Bing and Google Search Engines, collectively representing common datasets used in search engine-related research.AIISouls: This dataset contains essay questions from \"All Souls College, Oxford University,\" challenging generative engines to perform reasoning and aggregate information from multiple sources.LIMA: Contains challenging questions requiring generative engines to not only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning to answer the question, such as writing short poems or generating Python code.Davinci-Debate: Contains debate questions generated for testing generative engines.Perplexity.ai Discover: These queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai's Discover section, an updated list of trending queries on the platform.EII-5: This dataset contains questions from the ELIS subreddit, where users ask complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman terms.GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query distribution, GPT-4 is prompted to generate queries ranging from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and difficulty levels (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).Apart from queries, we also provide 5 cleaned html responses based on top Google search results.TagsOptimizing website content often requires making targeted changes based on the domain of the task. Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature. To this end, we tag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For tagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall and precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated system, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered as the sole basis for filtering or analysis.Difficulty Level- The complexity of the query, ranging from simple to complex.- Example of a simple query: \"What is the capital of France?\"- Example of a complex query: \"What are the implications of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics?\"Nature of Query- The type of information sought by the query, such as factual, opinion, or comparison.- Example of a factual query: \"How does a car engine work?\"- Example of an opinion query: \"What is your opinion on the Harry Potter series?\"Genre- The category or domain of the query, such as arts and entertainment, finance, or science.- Example of a query in the arts and entertainment genre: \"Who won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020?\"- Example of a query in the finance genre: \"What is the current exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar?\"Specific Topics- The specific subject matter of the query, such as physics, economics, or computer science.- Example of a query on a specific topic in physics: \"What is the theory of relativity?\"- Example of a query on a specific topic in economics: \"What is the law of supply and demand?\"Sensitivity- Whether the query involves sensitive topics or not.- Example of a non-sensitive query: \"What is the tallest mountain in the world?\"- Example of a sensitive query: \"What is the current political situation in North Korea?\"User Intent- The purpose behind the user's query, such as research, purchase, or entertainment.- Example of a research intent query: \"What are the health benefits of a vegetarian diet?\"- Example of a purchase intent query: \"Where can I buy the latest iPhone?\"Answer Type- The format of the answer that the query is seeking, such as fact, opinion, or list.- Example of a fact answer type query: \"What is the population of New York City?\"- Example of an opinion answer type query: \"Is it better to buy or rent a house?\"Additional InformationGeo-Bench is intended for research purposes and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of content optimization for generative engines.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

          "summary": "Traditional folk sports in Karnataka remain on the horns of a dilemma\nTraditional sports and rituals involving animals are an integral part of many communities in rural parts of Karnataka. Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across state\n\nYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deity\nFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.\n\nMembers of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\n\n\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.\n\nHowever, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.\n\nStatus: Banned\nOld Mysuru region\nCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu Haisodu\nKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.\nThe ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.\n\nStatus: Practised\nHubbali\nRam Fight of Savji Community\nSomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.\n\nAt present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.\n\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nHubbali\nKobri Hori competition\nKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.\n\nThe bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.\n\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nMangaluru, Udupi\nCock fighting or kori katte\nAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.\n\nA special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.\n\nThe event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\n\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from 20,000-25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,\u201d said activist Ravi.\n\nAccording to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nNorth Karnataka\nBullock cart racing\nBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years. The event which was widely held across the state is now restricted to parts of north Karnataka. The races are held during Dasara and Diwali. Participants race in bullock carts and winners receive prize money.\n\nStatus: No ban\nUdupi\nBuffalo racing or kambala\nKambala is an annual buffalo race organised by agrarian families after the harvest of Rabi crop. Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.\n\nIn the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals. The game has become an organised rural sport with committees setting up schedules and cash prizes.\n\nThe game is conducted across Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and even parts of Kasaragod in Kerala. However, the sport has been put on hold due to an interim ban by the High Court, following opposition by animal rights activists.\n\nPreviously, despite a petition for a ban on the event by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA), the races were held with regulations issued by local district administration.\nStatus: Interim ban",

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father.\\n\\nJekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories.\\n\\nStill in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner.\\n\\nWhen the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton.

The Storybrooke events take place after \\\"The Other Shoe\\\".In the Characters' Past[edit]In Victorian England, Dr. Jekyll is joined by his friend Mary Lydgate, whose father, Dr. Lydgate, is a member of a prestigious science academy, as he hopes to convince him to back his project that he created, a serum that separates personalities, only to be rejected. The experiment would later attract the attention of Rumplestiltskin, who suddenly appears and helps Jekyll perfect the serum, and when Jekyll drinks it, he transforms into Hyde for the first time. That night at a party, Hyde, with the help of Rumplestiltskin, confronts Mary\u2019s father and threatens to expose the truth about him sleeping with his lab assistant if he doesn\u2019t grant Jekyll his membership into the academy. In the morning, Jekyll wakes up and remembers nothing but finds himself to be an academy member.Later on, Rumplestiltskin influences Jekyll to become Hyde again, this time to win over Mary, revealing that Jekyll has strong feelings for her, but she admits that she isn\u2019t interested in the same way and wants a man who wants to embrace passion without getting rid of it, and the two kiss. The following morning, Jekyll and Mary are waking up in bed together and are shocked by the outcome, as Jekyll tries to convince her that he is Hyde, but Mary is upset that Jekyll tricked her and tries to run away, prompting an angry Jekyll to push Mary out of the window and to her death. Realizing what he has done, Jekyll drinks the last of the serum and escapes as Hyde.In Storybrooke[edit]At the Pawn shop, Gold is looking in the mirror and sees his hair as he prepares to cut it, giving him a more crew cut appearance. He is soon visited by the Evil Queen and Hyde, who demanded a necklace. As Gold choked Hyde, he learned that he cannot be killed by The Evil Queen, although she tells Gold that their deal to protect Belle and the baby is still in effect. When news leaks of Hyde escaping the hospital, this suddenly disrupts the normally for David and Snow, as well as for Emma and Hook, who is ready to move in with her. When Regina and Jekyll shows off the necklace, they soon discover that the serum will be vital in defeating The Evil Queen and Hyde. With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering. Later on, Regina asks Gold for help, only to discover the Evil Queen and Hyde have already destroyed the lab but Jekyll managed to save a tiny bit of the serum which Regina wants to use on the Evil Queen. Gold to steals Jekyll\u2019s heart to convince Regina to hand over the serum which he then pours the serum onto his dagger which will be useful in killing Hyde. As Gold leaves, he tosses Jekyll\u2019s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.In the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, and this time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he switched serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One\u2019s dagger and uses it to control Gold to take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to \\\"do what is necessary\\\" to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of \\\"weakness,\\\" but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that \u201cnecessity\u201d will make her love him once again.Back at Storybrooke Elementary School, Snow resumes her role as teacher, and introduces her new assistant Shirin to the class. Realizing that the students are struggling, Shirin suggests that Snow embrace her past to inspire them. Taking a cue from Isaac Newton, Snow uses her experience as an archer and the students are in awe, winning her confidence with them. At the end of the school day, Shirin later meets up with the Oracle, where they are coordinating plans to search for Aladdin, as Shirin is revealed to be Princess Jasmine.Production[edit]- Rebecca Mader, who was credited in this episode, was not featured.- The episode features Jonny Coyne as Dr. Lydgate, reprising the role he originated in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, thus establishing Jekyll and Hyde's \\\"Victorian England\\\" as the same \\\"realm of story\\\" that was featured on that show.- The reason why Gold cuts his hair is because, during the break between the fifth and sixth seasons, Robert Carlyle had filmed Trainspotting 2 which required his hair to be shortened (Carlyle having worn a wig for the season's previous episodes).Reception[edit]Ratings[edit]The episode saw a drop from the previous outing, posting a 1.1/4 rating among 18-49s with 3.48 million tuning in.[1]Reviews[edit]- Justin Kirkland of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+.[2]- The AV Club gave out pointers on the episode, giving positive points on Jekyll and Hyde's backstory and twist, but were mixed on the premise and scenes.[3]- Christine Laskodi of TV Fantic gave the episode a good review: 4.0 out of 5.0[4]References[edit]- ^ \\\"TV Ratings Sunday: \u2018Simpsons\u2019 600th episode scores, \u2018Quantico\u2019 hits series low on mostly down night\\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (October 17, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time premiere recap: Strange Case'\\\" from Entertainment Weekly (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Jekyll and Hyde\u2019s \u201cStrange Case\u201d on Once Upon A Time melds good with evil\\\" from AV Club (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time Review: Strange Case\\\" from TV Fanatic (October 16, 2016)\",\"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case\",\"cleaned_text\": \"\\\"Strange Case\\\" is the fourth episode of the sixth season of the American fantasy drama series Once Upon a Time, which aired on October 16, 2016.

It consists of 10,000 queries sourced from multiple real-world and synthetically generated queries, specifically curated and repurposed for generative engines. The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty level, query intent, and other dimensions.UsageYou can easily load and use Geo-Bench in Python using the datasetslibrary:import datasets# Load Geo-Benchdataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"GEO-optim/geo-bench\")Data SourceGeo-Bench is a compilation of queries from various sources, both real and synthetically generated, to create a benchmark tailored for generative engines. The datasets used in constructing Geo-Bench are as follows:MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: These datasets contain real anonymized user queries from Bing and Google Search Engines, collectively representing common datasets used in search engine-related research.AIISouls: This dataset contains essay questions from \"All Souls College, Oxford University,\" challenging generative engines to perform reasoning and aggregate information from multiple sources.LIMA: Contains challenging questions requiring generative engines to not only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning to answer the question, such as writing short poems or generating Python code.Davinci-Debate: Contains debate questions generated for testing generative engines.Perplexity.ai Discover: These queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai's Discover section, an updated list of trending queries on the platform.EII-5: This dataset contains questions from the ELIS subreddit, where users ask complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman terms.GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query distribution, GPT-4 is prompted to generate queries ranging from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and difficulty levels (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).Apart from queries, we also provide 5 cleaned html responses based on top Google search results.TagsOptimizing website content often requires making targeted changes based on the domain of the task. Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature. To this end, we tag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For tagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall and precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated system, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered as the sole basis for filtering or analysis.Difficulty Level- The complexity of the query, ranging from simple to complex.- Example of a simple query: \"What is the capital of France?\"- Example of a complex query: \"What are the implications of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics?\"Nature of Query- The type of information sought by the query, such as factual, opinion, or comparison.- Example of a factual query: \"How does a car engine work?\"- Example of an opinion query: \"What is your opinion on the Harry Potter series?\"Genre- The category or domain of the query, such as arts and entertainment, finance, or science.- Example of a query in the arts and entertainment genre: \"Who won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020?\"- Example of a query in the finance genre: \"What is the current exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar?\"Specific Topics- The specific subject matter of the query, such as physics, economics, or computer science.- Example of a query on a specific topic in physics: \"What is the theory of relativity?\"- Example of a query on a specific topic in economics: \"What is the law of supply and demand?\"Sensitivity- Whether the query involves sensitive topics or not.- Example of a non-sensitive query: \"What is the tallest mountain in the world?\"- Example of a sensitive query: \"What is the current political situation in North Korea?\"User Intent- The purpose behind the user's query, such as research, purchase, or entertainment.- Example of a research intent query: \"What are the health benefits of a vegetarian diet?\"- Example of a purchase intent query: \"Where can I buy the latest iPhone?\"Answer Type- The format of the answer that the query is seeking, such as fact, opinion, or list.- Example of a fact answer type query: \"What is the population of New York City?\"- Example of an opinion answer type query: \"Is it better to buy or rent a house?\"Additional InformationGeo-Bench is intended for research purposes and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of content optimization for generative engines.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

          "summary": "Traditional games have always been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. There are a variety of indoor, outdoor and board games that were popular in Karnataka. Many of these interesting games were played by both the young and the old.\n\nBut with the advent of computers, mobile phones and play stations the concept of playing games have drastically changed in the state along with the rest of the country. Though a few of the traditional games are still played in Karnataka, people dwelling in the cities have lost touch with most of the traditional games.\n\nLet us take a look at some of the traditional games that were once enthusiastically played across Karnataka.\nChinni Dandu (Gilli Danda)\nGilli danda is one of the most popular outdoor games played all over India and even in South Asia. It is called Chinni Dandu in Kannada. This game is believed to be the origin of many European and American games such as Cricket, Baseball and Softball. The game is played with a peg (gilli) and a stick (danda), both of which are made of wood. The stick is used to strike the peg. It is a team game that requires hand eye co-ordination and concentration of the player.\n\nBuguri (Spinning the top)\nSpinning the top or Lattu is a fun game played across many parts of India and Pakistan. It is known as Buguri in Kannada. It is an interesting traditional game where a wooden top is made to spin. There are grooves in the lower half of the top and a nail at the bottom to spin on. A string is wrapped around the grooves to deploy the top and make it spin.\n\nGoti (Marbles)\nPopularly known as marbles, kancha or goli, it is a much loved gully sport in the country. It is called Goti in Kannada. This classic game requires the player to hit the selected target \u2018marble\u2019 using his/her own marble ball. The winner of the game walks away with all the marbles of the other players. This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.\n\nKabaddi\nKabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.\n\nKallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)\nKallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka. It requires the participants to lift round stone balls (called kallu gundu in Kannada) of various sizes and weights. The sport demands that the players be physically strong enough to lift heavy stones.\n\nPagade\nPagade is a cross and circle board game that is very similar to the ancient game of Pachisi or Chaupad. This game requires 2 or 4 players to race their respective pawns to reach the innermost square. The origin of the game can be traced to 4th century AD and it has remained popular throughout history.\n\nChowka Bara (Chakaara)\nChauka Bara is one of the oldest board games of India that is still played in some parts of the country. It is known as Chowka Bara in Mysuru and as Chakaara or Chakka in north Karnataka. This game is similar to ludo and can be played by 4 players. It is a game of chance that is played with cowry shells (called kavade in Kannada). The players attempt to race their pawns from the starting point to the safety of home. The game improves eye-to-eye coordination and teaches to make strategies.\n\nAshtapada\nAshtapada is an Indian board game that originated before chess. The game is played on a board having eight-by-eight grid of squares of same colour and the board has special markings known as \u201ccastles\u201d. Each player has an even number of game pieces and the objective is to move a game piece around the board in clockwise direction, enter the castle, and regain the castle back in a counter-clockwise direction so as to make the game piece reach the center. It can be played by 2 or 4 players.\n\nParamapada (Snakes & Ladders)\nSnakes & Ladders is a classic board game that originated in ancient India. It is known as Paramapada in Kannada. The game can be played by two or more players on a game-board that has numbered, gridded squares. The board has several ladders and snakes drawn on it. Players have to navigate their game piece from the start to the finish based on die rolls. The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.\n\nAli Guli Mane\nAli Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.\n\nLagori (Seven Stones)\nA stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.\n\nAdu Huli Aata (Tiger & Goat)\nTiger and goat is a hunt game that is known as Adu Huli Aata in Kannada. The game is played between 2 players where one player gets 3 tigers and the other player has 15 goats. The game is about the tigers trying to kill the goats while the goats look for ways to immobilize the tigers. This game requires planning and concentration on part of both the players.\n\nSaalu Mane Ata (Nine Men\u2019s Morris)\nNine Men\u2019s Morris is a traditional board game that originated in the western world. It is known as Saalu Mane Ata or Jodpi Ata or Char-Par in Kannada and is popular as Navakankari in various parts of India. This alignment game requires 2 players. Each player is given 9 coins and they try to achieve as many points as possible by getting 3 coins in a row on the game board. It is a complex game that requires strategic thinking.\n\nKunte Bille (Hopscotch)\nHopscotch is a traditional children\u2019s game that is known as Kunte Bille in Kannada.

          "summary": "Traditional folk sports in Karnataka remain on the horns of a dilemma\nTraditional sports and rituals involving animals are an integral part of many communities in rural parts of Karnataka. Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across state\n\nYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deity\nFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.\n\nMembers of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\n\n\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.\n\nHowever, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin.

The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums.

Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.\n\nIn the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals. The game has become an organised rural sport with committees setting up schedules and cash prizes.\n\nThe game is conducted across Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and even parts of Kasaragod in Kerala. However, the sport has been put on hold due to an interim ban by the High Court, following opposition by animal rights activists.\n\nPreviously, despite a petition for a ban on the event by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA), the races were held with regulations issued by local district administration.\nStatus: Interim ban",

They help children improve their motor and social skills. Read this post to know about these and many other indoor and outdoor traditional Indian games.\\n\\nTraditional Indian Indoor Games\\nTraditional Indian indoor games usually require a lot of mental work and improve children\u2019s problem-solving skills. Some of these games have also been adopted by the Western world, and now we know them by their more popular English names.\\n\\n1. Pachisi/Chaupar\\n\\nPachisi or Chaupar is a well-known board game since it was the genesis of the Kurukshetra war in Mahabharata. The Mughals were fond of this game, too. Pachisi was traditionally played on a symmetrical cross cloth. On the other hand, Chaupar was a board game invented in the 4th century.\\n\\nIn both these games, two to four players use cowrie shells and dice to plan their maneuvers and attack opponents. Now, you call this game Ludo, one of the more popular games today. Pachisi or Chaupar is an excellent game to teach your child how to plan and execute.\\n\\n2. Anchankal/Kallankal\\n\\nThis game is widely played in Tamil Nadu. As the name of the game suggests, Anchankal is a game composed of five stones. The game improves hand-eye coordination, concentration, memory, and aiming abilities. This is a very engaging game, and the best part is that you can create your own steps.\\n\\nIn the original game, you use five smooth stones that can be held in your hand. Place the stones on the floor or any flat surface. Pick one stone, toss it in the air, and while that stone is in the air, pick another stone from the ground, while catching the stone tossed in the air before it hits the ground. Repeat this with the rest of the stones.\\n\\nYou can continue this game by picking up different numbers of stones from the floor, or even throwing a different number of stones into the air, and then picking up other stones before other stones fall. It is important that you should not let the stones tossed in the air fall on the ground. It requires some practice, but once you master it, you can enjoy hours of entertainment.\\n\\n3. Ashtapada\\n\\nAshtapada is the predecessor of chess. Just like a chessboard, the Ashtapada board is also divided into an 8\u00d78 square grids but of one color. Ashtapada is a dice game. There are markings on the corners and the center square of the board. These squares are called castles. The pieces on these squares are safe, captured, or removed by the opponents.\\n\\nEach player starts with an even number of pieces to play the game. The pieces must be moved clockwise around the board to enter the castle on the outer edge. Then they enter the castle in the center in a clockwise direction. This is a game to reach the castle.\\n\\nAnother variation of Ashtapada is Dasapada that is played on a 10\u00d710 board.\\n4. Chaturanga\\n\\nChaturanga is an ancient strategy game invented in India. It is believed to be the ancestor of strategy games, such as Chess, Xiangqi, Shogi, and Makruk. Chaturanga is mentioned in many ancient scripts. It is played on the Ashtapada board. There are two players.\\n\\nJust like modern chess, Chaturanga has various pieces \u2014 the King (Raja), General (Mantri or Senapati), Rook (Ratha), Elephant/Bishop (Gaja), Horse/Knight (Ashva), and Pawn (Padaati or Bhata). Each piece moves in a certain direction.\\n\\nThe ultimate goal is to get the opponent\u2019s king into trouble so that he cannot move without being taken by the enemy. Kings and generals played this game to gain new ideas about the form of war offensive.\\n\\n5. Pallankuzhi\\n\\nIt is believed that this ancient game originated in Tamil Nadu but later spread to other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka. This game gained popularity even in Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The game is still played in some rural parts of India and is called Kuzhipara, Ali Guli Mane, or Picchala Peeta in different languages.\\n\\nIn this game, we use a rectangular board that is divided into two rows and seven cups. Players must use 146 counters to put in these cups. These counters are usually cowrie shells or tamarind shells. Each cup contains 12 counters. In the middle row cups, only two counters are placed. There are two players taking turns.\\n\\nThe starting player picks the counters from any of the holes on their side and assigns a counter to each cup in a counterclockwise direction. Once they reach the end of their cups, they move on to their opponent\u2019s cups. When their counters are over, they pick the counters from the next cup and continue the game. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the next cup are captured by the player. The next player takes over.\\n\\nThe game continues until the last counter falls in a cup with two empty cups beyond it. The player can capture no more counters, and their turn is over.\\n\\nIn this intricate game, there are other rules that make it interesting. Although this game is best played between two players, even one person can play the game on a lazy afternoon. Pallankuzhi can be played by both children and adults.\\n\\n6. Antakshari\\n\\nAntakshari is one of the most popular traditional Indian games. The game is played widely in social gatherings and weddings. Children play it in their free time at school. The best thing about this game is that it can also be played in a small space, just like when traveling in a car.\\n\\nAntakshari is the best way to spend time. You need to have a repertoire of songs to play this game. You can play this game in a team. Each team sings in turns, starting from the last letter of the previous song sung by the other team.\\n\\n7. Moksha Patam\\n\\nMoksha Patam or Parama Padam is a board game that is believed to have been invented in ancient India and has spread to other parts of the world. Now, it is commonly called Snakes and Ladders. In ancient India, it was used as a form of entertainment and to teach morality to children.\\n\\nThe basic concept is to teach people that the way to reach heaven or \u201cmoksha\u201d is to abandon the bondage of passion. The ladder symbolizes the rise from one level of enlightenment to another, while the snake symbolizes immoral behavior and how they lead to degeneration. This game is played by two to four players. The first player to reach the \u201chighest heaven\u201d is the winner.\\n\\n8. Aadu puli aatam\\n\\nAadu puli aatam literally means \u201ca game of lambs and tigers.\u201d It is called meka puli aata in Telugu and aadu huli aata in Kannada. This is a two-player game where the tigers hunt goats on an asymmetric grid.\\n\\nIn this game, first, draw a triangle and divide it into three equal parts. Then, draw a rectangle on the entire triangle, intersecting it throughout. Then divide the rectangle horizontally into two parts. One player has 15 \u201cgoats,\u201d and the other player has three \u201ctigers.\u201d Each of these pieces is placed at the intersection point. Tigers try to eat goats, and goats try to actively stop them. The pieces are usually cowrie shells or pebbles.\\n\\n9. Chowkabara\\n\\nThis is another four-player game that is similar to Chaupar or Ludo. The goal of the game is to achieve home safety without getting removed by the opponents\u2019 pieces. The game is popular all over India and is known under different names, such as Eight and Four, Kattam Kalo, Chauka Baara, Changapoo, Ettu Veedu, Kattam Kazhi, and Aada Sada.\\n\\n10.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

The Storybrooke events take place after \\\"The Other Shoe\\\".In the Characters' Past[edit]In Victorian England, Dr. Jekyll is joined by his friend Mary Lydgate, whose father, Dr. Lydgate, is a member of a prestigious science academy, as he hopes to convince him to back his project that he created, a serum that separates personalities, only to be rejected. The experiment would later attract the attention of Rumplestiltskin, who suddenly appears and helps Jekyll perfect the serum, and when Jekyll drinks it, he transforms into Hyde for the first time. That night at a party, Hyde, with the help of Rumplestiltskin, confronts Mary\u2019s father and threatens to expose the truth about him sleeping with his lab assistant if he doesn\u2019t grant Jekyll his membership into the academy. In the morning, Jekyll wakes up and remembers nothing but finds himself to be an academy member.Later on, Rumplestiltskin influences Jekyll to become Hyde again, this time to win over Mary, revealing that Jekyll has strong feelings for her, but she admits that she isn\u2019t interested in the same way and wants a man who wants to embrace passion without getting rid of it, and the two kiss. The following morning, Jekyll and Mary are waking up in bed together and are shocked by the outcome, as Jekyll tries to convince her that he is Hyde, but Mary is upset that Jekyll tricked her and tries to run away, prompting an angry Jekyll to push Mary out of the window and to her death. Realizing what he has done, Jekyll drinks the last of the serum and escapes as Hyde.In Storybrooke[edit]At the Pawn shop, Gold is looking in the mirror and sees his hair as he prepares to cut it, giving him a more crew cut appearance. He is soon visited by the Evil Queen and Hyde, who demanded a necklace. As Gold choked Hyde, he learned that he cannot be killed by The Evil Queen, although she tells Gold that their deal to protect Belle and the baby is still in effect. When news leaks of Hyde escaping the hospital, this suddenly disrupts the normally for David and Snow, as well as for Emma and Hook, who is ready to move in with her. When Regina and Jekyll shows off the necklace, they soon discover that the serum will be vital in defeating The Evil Queen and Hyde. With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering. Later on, Regina asks Gold for help, only to discover the Evil Queen and Hyde have already destroyed the lab but Jekyll managed to save a tiny bit of the serum which Regina wants to use on the Evil Queen. Gold to steals Jekyll\u2019s heart to convince Regina to hand over the serum which he then pours the serum onto his dagger which will be useful in killing Hyde. As Gold leaves, he tosses Jekyll\u2019s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.In the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, and this time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he switched serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One\u2019s dagger and uses it to control Gold to take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to \\\"do what is necessary\\\" to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of \\\"weakness,\\\" but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that \u201cnecessity\u201d will make her love him once again.Back at Storybrooke Elementary School, Snow resumes her role as teacher, and introduces her new assistant Shirin to the class. Realizing that the students are struggling, Shirin suggests that Snow embrace her past to inspire them. Taking a cue from Isaac Newton, Snow uses her experience as an archer and the students are in awe, winning her confidence with them. At the end of the school day, Shirin later meets up with the Oracle, where they are coordinating plans to search for Aladdin, as Shirin is revealed to be Princess Jasmine.Production[edit]- Rebecca Mader, who was credited in this episode, was not featured.- The episode features Jonny Coyne as Dr. Lydgate, reprising the role he originated in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, thus establishing Jekyll and Hyde's \\\"Victorian England\\\" as the same \\\"realm of story\\\" that was featured on that show.- The reason why Gold cuts his hair is because, during the break between the fifth and sixth seasons, Robert Carlyle had filmed Trainspotting 2 which required his hair to be shortened (Carlyle having worn a wig for the season's previous episodes).Reception[edit]Ratings[edit]The episode saw a drop from the previous outing, posting a 1.1/4 rating among 18-49s with 3.48 million tuning in.[1]Reviews[edit]- Justin Kirkland of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+.[2]- The AV Club gave out pointers on the episode, giving positive points on Jekyll and Hyde's backstory and twist, but were mixed on the premise and scenes.[3]- Christine Laskodi of TV Fantic gave the episode a good review: 4.0 out of 5.0[4]References[edit]- ^ \\\"TV Ratings Sunday: \u2018Simpsons\u2019 600th episode scores, \u2018Quantico\u2019 hits series low on mostly down night\\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (October 17, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time premiere recap: Strange Case'\\\" from Entertainment Weekly (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Jekyll and Hyde\u2019s \u201cStrange Case\u201d on Once Upon A Time melds good with evil\\\" from AV Club (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time Review: Strange Case\\\" from TV Fanatic (October 16, 2016)\",\"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case\",\"cleaned_text\": \"\\\"Strange Case\\\" is the fourth episode of the sixth season of the American fantasy drama series Once Upon a Time, which aired on October 16, 2016.

As Gold leaves, he tosses Jekyll\u2019s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.\\n\\nIn the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, and this time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he switched serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One\u2019s dagger and uses it to control Gold to take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to \\\"do what is necessary\\\" to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of \\\"weakness,\\\" but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that \u201cnecessity\u201d will make her love him once again.\\n\\nAt the end of the school day, Shirin later meets up with the Oracle, where they are coordinating plans to search for Aladdin, as Shirin is revealed to be Princess Jasmine.\"}] | 4 |who was the aztec ruler when the spanish arrived| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"history\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"historical\",\"research\",\"non-s(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Part of the (...TRUNCATED) | 1 |an open-source clone of unix created in the early 1990s| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"computers and electronics\",\"technical\",\"statement\",\"fact\",\"historical\",\"r(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"If you are a software developer in your 20s or 30s, you've grown up in a world dominat(...TRUNCATED) | 4 |when is an articulated lorry most likely to jackknife| [\"informational\",\"intermediate\",\"autos and vehicles\",\"technical\",\"question\",\"research\",\"fact\",\"non-s(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"This website uses cookies to improve your experience while you navigate through the we(...TRUNCATED) | 4 |how many mla and mp seats in telangana| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"law and government\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"research\",\"non-sen(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"2018 Telangana Legislative Assembly electionParts of this article (those related to so(...TRUNCATED) | 3 |does england have the right to bear arms| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"law and government\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"research\",\"non-sen(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"Passages of Arms: The English Bill of Rights and the American Second AmendmentSunday, (...TRUNCATED) | 1 |who won the champions league final in 2016| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"sports\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"historical\",\"research\",\"non-se(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"It was another epic encounter between these old rivals, featuring some of the best and(...TRUNCATED) | 4 |where do the hearts of palm come from| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"food and drink\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"research\",\"non-sensiti(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"Most of us have tried, or at least heard of, a vegetable called the heart of palm.

It consists of 10,000 queries sourced from multiple real-world and synthetically generated queries, specifically curated and repurposed for generative engines. The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty level, query intent, and other dimensions.UsageYou can easily load and use Geo-Bench in Python using the datasetslibrary:import datasets# Load Geo-Benchdataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"GEO-optim/geo-bench\")Data SourceGeo-Bench is a compilation of queries from various sources, both real and synthetically generated, to create a benchmark tailored for generative engines. The datasets used in constructing Geo-Bench are as follows:MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: These datasets contain real anonymized user queries from Bing and Google Search Engines, collectively representing common datasets used in search engine-related research.AIISouls: This dataset contains essay questions from \"All Souls College, Oxford University,\" challenging generative engines to perform reasoning and aggregate information from multiple sources.LIMA: Contains challenging questions requiring generative engines to not only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning to answer the question, such as writing short poems or generating Python code.Davinci-Debate: Contains debate questions generated for testing generative engines.Perplexity.ai Discover: These queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai's Discover section, an updated list of trending queries on the platform.EII-5: This dataset contains questions from the ELIS subreddit, where users ask complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman terms.GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query distribution, GPT-4 is prompted to generate queries ranging from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and difficulty levels (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).Apart from queries, we also provide 5 cleaned html responses based on top Google search results.TagsOptimizing website content often requires making targeted changes based on the domain of the task. Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature. To this end, we tag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For tagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall and precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated system, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered as the sole basis for filtering or analysis.Difficulty Level- The complexity of the query, ranging from simple to complex.- Example of a simple query: \"What is the capital of France?\"- Example of a complex query: \"What are the implications of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics?\"Nature of Query- The type of information sought by the query, such as factual, opinion, or comparison.- Example of a factual query: \"How does a car engine work?\"- Example of an opinion query: \"What is your opinion on the Harry Potter series?\"Genre- The category or domain of the query, such as arts and entertainment, finance, or science.- Example of a query in the arts and entertainment genre: \"Who won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020?\"- Example of a query in the finance genre: \"What is the current exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar?\"Specific Topics- The specific subject matter of the query, such as physics, economics, or computer science.- Example of a query on a specific topic in physics: \"What is the theory of relativity?\"- Example of a query on a specific topic in economics: \"What is the law of supply and demand?\"Sensitivity- Whether the query involves sensitive topics or not.- Example of a non-sensitive query: \"What is the tallest mountain in the world?\"- Example of a sensitive query: \"What is the current political situation in North Korea?\"User Intent- The purpose behind the user's query, such as research, purchase, or entertainment.- Example of a research intent query: \"What are the health benefits of a vegetarian diet?\"- Example of a purchase intent query: \"Where can I buy the latest iPhone?\"Answer Type- The format of the answer that the query is seeking, such as fact, opinion, or list.- Example of a fact answer type query: \"What is the population of New York City?\"- Example of an opinion answer type query: \"Is it better to buy or rent a house?\"Additional InformationGeo-Bench is intended for research purposes and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of content optimization for generative engines.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

          "summary": "Traditional games have always been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. There are a variety of indoor, outdoor and board games that were popular in Karnataka. Many of these interesting games were played by both the young and the old.\n\nBut with the advent of computers, mobile phones and play stations the concept of playing games have drastically changed in the state along with the rest of the country. Though a few of the traditional games are still played in Karnataka, people dwelling in the cities have lost touch with most of the traditional games.\n\nLet us take a look at some of the traditional games that were once enthusiastically played across Karnataka.\nChinni Dandu (Gilli Danda)\nGilli danda is one of the most popular outdoor games played all over India and even in South Asia. It is called Chinni Dandu in Kannada. This game is believed to be the origin of many European and American games such as Cricket, Baseball and Softball. The game is played with a peg (gilli) and a stick (danda), both of which are made of wood. The stick is used to strike the peg. It is a team game that requires hand eye co-ordination and concentration of the player.\n\nBuguri (Spinning the top)\nSpinning the top or Lattu is a fun game played across many parts of India and Pakistan. It is known as Buguri in Kannada. It is an interesting traditional game where a wooden top is made to spin. There are grooves in the lower half of the top and a nail at the bottom to spin on. A string is wrapped around the grooves to deploy the top and make it spin.\n\nGoti (Marbles)\nPopularly known as marbles, kancha or goli, it is a much loved gully sport in the country. It is called Goti in Kannada. This classic game requires the player to hit the selected target \u2018marble\u2019 using his/her own marble ball. The winner of the game walks away with all the marbles of the other players. This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.\n\nKabaddi\nKabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.\n\nKallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)\nKallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka. It requires the participants to lift round stone balls (called kallu gundu in Kannada) of various sizes and weights. The sport demands that the players be physically strong enough to lift heavy stones.\n\nPagade\nPagade is a cross and circle board game that is very similar to the ancient game of Pachisi or Chaupad. This game requires 2 or 4 players to race their respective pawns to reach the innermost square. The origin of the game can be traced to 4th century AD and it has remained popular throughout history.\n\nChowka Bara (Chakaara)\nChauka Bara is one of the oldest board games of India that is still played in some parts of the country. It is known as Chowka Bara in Mysuru and as Chakaara or Chakka in north Karnataka. This game is similar to ludo and can be played by 4 players. It is a game of chance that is played with cowry shells (called kavade in Kannada). The players attempt to race their pawns from the starting point to the safety of home. The game improves eye-to-eye coordination and teaches to make strategies.\n\nAshtapada\nAshtapada is an Indian board game that originated before chess. The game is played on a board having eight-by-eight grid of squares of same colour and the board has special markings known as \u201ccastles\u201d. Each player has an even number of game pieces and the objective is to move a game piece around the board in clockwise direction, enter the castle, and regain the castle back in a counter-clockwise direction so as to make the game piece reach the center. It can be played by 2 or 4 players.\n\nParamapada (Snakes & Ladders)\nSnakes & Ladders is a classic board game that originated in ancient India. It is known as Paramapada in Kannada. The game can be played by two or more players on a game-board that has numbered, gridded squares. The board has several ladders and snakes drawn on it. Players have to navigate their game piece from the start to the finish based on die rolls. The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.\n\nAli Guli Mane\nAli Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.\n\nLagori (Seven Stones)\nA stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.\n\nAdu Huli Aata (Tiger & Goat)\nTiger and goat is a hunt game that is known as Adu Huli Aata in Kannada. The game is played between 2 players where one player gets 3 tigers and the other player has 15 goats. The game is about the tigers trying to kill the goats while the goats look for ways to immobilize the tigers. This game requires planning and concentration on part of both the players.\n\nSaalu Mane Ata (Nine Men\u2019s Morris)\nNine Men\u2019s Morris is a traditional board game that originated in the western world. It is known as Saalu Mane Ata or Jodpi Ata or Char-Par in Kannada and is popular as Navakankari in various parts of India. This alignment game requires 2 players. Each player is given 9 coins and they try to achieve as many points as possible by getting 3 coins in a row on the game board. It is a complex game that requires strategic thinking.\n\nKunte Bille (Hopscotch)\nHopscotch is a traditional children\u2019s game that is known as Kunte Bille in Kannada. The game can be played alone or with several players. It involves drawing a court on the ground and then tossing a small object into the numbered rectangles of the court. The player then needs to hop or jump through the spaces in order to retrieve the object.\n\nKambala (Buffalo Race)\nKambala or Buffalo Race is a rural sport of Karnataka. This traditional sport involves farmers racing the buffaloes through tracks are ploughed into a muddy field that is made slushy with water. The sport is a source of much enjoyment for the rural folks of the state.\n\nHagga Jaggata (Tug of War)\nTug of war or rope pulling is an age-old sport that is known as Hagga Jaggata in Kannada. The sport involves two teams who pull on opposite ends of a rope in a test of strength. The objective is to pull the rope by both teams at opposite ends until one team drags the other over a central line.\n\nNaaku Kallu Aata (Four Stone)\nFour stone is an ancient traditional game that is known as Naaku Kallu Aata in Karnataka. It requires four independent boxes to be drawn on the ground. One player each stands in the four boxes and tries to take the four stones placed at the centre without being caught by the chaser in the game.\n\nHand Wrestling\nHand wrestling is enthusiastically played by the folks of",

Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across stateYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deityFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.Members of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.However, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.Status: BannedOld Mysuru regionCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu HaisoduKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.The ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara,The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.Status: PractisedHubbaliRam Fight of Savji CommunitySomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.At present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.Status: Banned, illegally practisedHubbaliKobri Hori competitionKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.The bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.Status: Banned, illegally practisedMangaluru, UdupiCock fighting or kori katteAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.A special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.The event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from `20,000-`25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,\u201d said activist Ravi.According to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.Status: Banned, illegally practisedNorth KarnatakaBullock cart racingBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years. The event which was widely held across the state is now restricted to parts of north Karnataka. The races are held during Dasara and Diwali.

Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.In the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals. The game has become an organised rural sport with committees setting up schedules and cash prizes.The game is conducted across Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and even parts of Kasaragod in Kerala. However, the sport has been put on hold due to an interim ban by the High Court, following opposition by animal rights activists.Previously, despite a petition for a ban on the event by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA), the races were held with regulations issued by local district administration.status: Interim ban",

Sadly, today\u2019s kids are so engrossed in playing video games that traditional games like Pallanguzi, Lippa, Kabaddi, Gilli-danda have been completely forgotten. Gone are the days when kids simply couldn\u2019t wait to go out and play a few rounds of Pithoo or Kith-Kith (Hopscotch) with their friends. The reduction in physical activity has given rise to a host of health issues in kids. Therefore, reviving traditional games will provide a host of health benefits. In this article, we will discuss both indoor and outdoor traditional Indian games. This will hopefully encourage little ones to play traditional games of India more often and keep traditions passing down from generation to generation.\n\nWhat Are Traditional Games?\nTraditional games are simply games which have been an important part of our culture for decades. These are often passed down from one generation to another.\n\nWhat Is The Importance Of Indian Traditional Games?\nIndian Traditional Games teach us a lot of essential day-to-day things like:\n- Help children learn how to count\n- Boosts memory and observation skills\n- Improves hand-eye coordination\n- Allows you to make meaningful choices\n- Fosters team spirit\n- Teaches strategy-building\n- Improves aim and focus\n- Improves body coordination\n\nIndian Traditional Indoor Games\nWe can play some games indoors whilst others are played outdoors. Both are equally enjoyed and can be played with a varying number of players. In this section, we will talk about some Indian traditional indoor games.

          "summary": "Traditional folk sports in Karnataka remain on the horns of a dilemma\nTraditional sports and rituals involving animals are an integral part of many communities in rural parts of Karnataka. Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across state\n\nYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deity\nFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.\n\nMembers of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\n\n\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.\n\nHowever, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.\n\nStatus: Banned\nOld Mysuru region\nCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu Haisodu\nKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.\nThe ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.\n\nStatus: Practised\nHubbali\nRam Fight of Savji Community\nSomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.\n\nAt present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.\n\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nHubbali\nKobri Hori competition\nKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.\n\nThe bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.\n\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nMangaluru, Udupi\nCock fighting or kori katte\nAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.\n\nA special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.\n\nThe event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\n\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from 20,000-25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,\u201d said activist Ravi.\n\nAccording to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nNorth Karnataka\nBullock cart racing\nBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years. The event which was widely held across the state is now restricted to parts of north Karnataka. The races are held during Dasara and Diwali. Participants race in bullock carts and winners receive prize money.\n\nStatus: No ban\nUdupi\nBuffalo racing or kambala\nKambala is an annual buffalo race organised by agrarian families after the harvest of Rabi crop. Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.\n\nIn the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals. The game has become an organised rural sport with committees setting up schedules and cash prizes.\n\nThe game is conducted across Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and even parts of Kasaragod in Kerala. However, the sport has been put on hold due to an interim ban by the High Court, following opposition by animal rights activists.\n\nPreviously, despite a petition for a ban on the event by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA), the races were held with regulations issued by local district administration.\nStatus: Interim ban",

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.\\n\\nDr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.\\nHistory\\nDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father.\\n\\nJekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories.\\n\\nStill in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner.\\n\\nWhen the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde.\\n\\nAt the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with.\\n\\nJekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece.\\n\\n\"},{\"raw_text\": \"On the Season 6 premiere episode of Once Upon a Time, \u2018The Savior,\u2019 while refugees from the Land of Untold Stories invade Storybrooke and in a flashback Jafar (Oded Fehr) confronts Aladdin (Deniz Akdeniz), Emma (Jennifer Morrison) and the heroes try to stop Mr. Hyde which won\u2019t be easy.

The Storybrooke events take place after \\\"The Other Shoe\\\".In the Characters' Past[edit]In Victorian England, Dr. Jekyll is joined by his friend Mary Lydgate, whose father, Dr. Lydgate, is a member of a prestigious science academy, as he hopes to convince him to back his project that he created, a serum that separates personalities, only to be rejected. The experiment would later attract the attention of Rumplestiltskin, who suddenly appears and helps Jekyll perfect the serum, and when Jekyll drinks it, he transforms into Hyde for the first time. That night at a party, Hyde, with the help of Rumplestiltskin, confronts Mary\u2019s father and threatens to expose the truth about him sleeping with his lab assistant if he doesn\u2019t grant Jekyll his membership into the academy. In the morning, Jekyll wakes up and remembers nothing but finds himself to be an academy member.Later on, Rumplestiltskin influences Jekyll to become Hyde again, this time to win over Mary, revealing that Jekyll has strong feelings for her, but she admits that she isn\u2019t interested in the same way and wants a man who wants to embrace passion without getting rid of it, and the two kiss.

He is soon visited by the Evil Queen and Hyde, who demanded a necklace. As Gold choked Hyde, he learned that he cannot be killed by The Evil Queen, although she tells Gold that their deal to protect Belle and the baby is still in effect. When news leaks of Hyde escaping the hospital, this suddenly disrupts the normally for David and Snow, as well as for Emma and Hook, who is ready to move in with her. When Regina and Jekyll shows off the necklace, they soon discover that the serum will be vital in defeating The Evil Queen and Hyde. With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering. Later on, Regina asks Gold for help, only to discover the Evil Queen and Hyde have already destroyed the lab but Jekyll managed to save a tiny bit of the serum which Regina wants to use on the Evil Queen. Gold to steals Jekyll\u2019s heart to convince Regina to hand over the serum which he then pours the serum onto his dagger which will be useful in killing Hyde. As Gold leaves, he tosses Jekyll\u2019s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.In the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, and this time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he switched serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One\u2019s dagger and uses it to control Gold to take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to \\\"do what is necessary\\\" to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of \\\"weakness,\\\" but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that \u201cnecessity\u201d will make her love him once again.Back at Storybrooke Elementary School, Snow resumes her role as teacher, and introduces her new assistant Shirin to the class.

It consists of 10,000 queries sourced from multiple real-world and synthetically generated queries, specifically curated and repurposed for generative engines. The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty level, query intent, and other dimensions.UsageYou can easily load and use Geo-Bench in Python using the datasetslibrary:import datasets# Load Geo-Benchdataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"GEO-optim/geo-bench\")Data SourceGeo-Bench is a compilation of queries from various sources, both real and synthetically generated, to create a benchmark tailored for generative engines. The datasets used in constructing Geo-Bench are as follows:MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: These datasets contain real anonymized user queries from Bing and Google Search Engines, collectively representing common datasets used in search engine-related research.AIISouls: This dataset contains essay questions from \"All Souls College, Oxford University,\" challenging generative engines to perform reasoning and aggregate information from multiple sources.LIMA: Contains challenging questions requiring generative engines to not only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning to answer the question, such as writing short poems or generating Python code.Davinci-Debate: Contains debate questions generated for testing generative engines.Perplexity.ai Discover: These queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai's Discover section, an updated list of trending queries on the platform.EII-5: This dataset contains questions from the ELIS subreddit, where users ask complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman terms.GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query distribution, GPT-4 is prompted to generate queries ranging from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and difficulty levels (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).Apart from queries, we also provide 5 cleaned html responses based on top Google search results.TagsOptimizing website content often requires making targeted changes based on the domain of the task. Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

          "summary": "Traditional folk sports in Karnataka remain on the horns of a dilemma\nTraditional sports and rituals involving animals are an integral part of many communities in rural parts of Karnataka. Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across state\n\nYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deity\nFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.\n\nMembers of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\n\n\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.\n\nHowever, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.\n\nStatus: Banned\nOld Mysuru region\nCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu Haisodu\nKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.\nThe ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.\n\nStatus: Practised\nHubbali\nRam Fight of Savji Community\nSomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.\n\nAt present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.\n\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nHubbali\nKobri Hori competition\nKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.\n\nThe bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.\n\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nMangaluru, Udupi\nCock fighting or kori katte\nAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.\n\nA special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes.

They help children improve their motor and social skills. Read this post to know about these and many other indoor and outdoor traditional Indian games.\\n\\nTraditional Indian Indoor Games\\nTraditional Indian indoor games usually require a lot of mental work and improve children\u2019s problem-solving skills. Some of these games have also been adopted by the Western world, and now we know them by their more popular English names.\\n\\n1. Pachisi/Chaupar\\n\\nPachisi or Chaupar is a well-known board game since it was the genesis of the Kurukshetra war in Mahabharata. The Mughals were fond of this game, too. Pachisi was traditionally played on a symmetrical cross cloth. On the other hand, Chaupar was a board game invented in the 4th century.\\n\\nIn both these games, two to four players use cowrie shells and dice to plan their maneuvers and attack opponents. Now, you call this game Ludo, one of the more popular games today. Pachisi or Chaupar is an excellent game to teach your child how to plan and execute.\\n\\n2. Anchankal/Kallankal\\n\\nThis game is widely played in Tamil Nadu. As the name of the game suggests, Anchankal is a game composed of five stones. The game improves hand-eye coordination, concentration, memory, and aiming abilities. This is a very engaging game, and the best part is that you can create your own steps.\\n\\nIn the original game, you use five smooth stones that can be held in your hand. Place the stones on the floor or any flat surface. Pick one stone, toss it in the air, and while that stone is in the air, pick another stone from the ground, while catching the stone tossed in the air before it hits the ground. Repeat this with the rest of the stones.\\n\\nYou can continue this game by picking up different numbers of stones from the floor, or even throwing a different number of stones into the air, and then picking up other stones before other stones fall. It is important that you should not let the stones tossed in the air fall on the ground. It requires some practice, but once you master it, you can enjoy hours of entertainment.\\n\\n3. Ashtapada\\n\\nAshtapada is the predecessor of chess. Just like a chessboard, the Ashtapada board is also divided into an 8\u00d78 square grids but of one color. Ashtapada is a dice game. There are markings on the corners and the center square of the board. These squares are called castles. The pieces on these squares are safe, captured, or removed by the opponents.\\n\\nEach player starts with an even number of pieces to play the game. The pieces must be moved clockwise around the board to enter the castle on the outer edge. Then they enter the castle in the center in a clockwise direction. This is a game to reach the castle.\\n\\nAnother variation of Ashtapada is Dasapada that is played on a 10\u00d710 board.\\n4. Chaturanga\\n\\nChaturanga is an ancient strategy game invented in India. It is believed to be the ancestor of strategy games, such as Chess, Xiangqi, Shogi, and Makruk. Chaturanga is mentioned in many ancient scripts. It is played on the Ashtapada board. There are two players.\\n\\nJust like modern chess, Chaturanga has various pieces \u2014 the King (Raja), General (Mantri or Senapati), Rook (Ratha), Elephant/Bishop (Gaja), Horse/Knight (Ashva), and Pawn (Padaati or Bhata). Each piece moves in a certain direction.\\n\\nThe ultimate goal is to get the opponent\u2019s king into trouble so that he cannot move without being taken by the enemy. Kings and generals played this game to gain new ideas about the form of war offensive.\\n\\n5. Pallankuzhi\\n\\nIt is believed that this ancient game originated in Tamil Nadu but later spread to other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka. This game gained popularity even in Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The game is still played in some rural parts of India and is called Kuzhipara, Ali Guli Mane, or Picchala Peeta in different languages.\\n\\nIn this game, we use a rectangular board that is divided into two rows and seven cups. Players must use 146 counters to put in these cups. These counters are usually cowrie shells or tamarind shells. Each cup contains 12 counters. In the middle row cups, only two counters are placed. There are two players taking turns.\\n\\nThe starting player picks the counters from any of the holes on their side and assigns a counter to each cup in a counterclockwise direction. Once they reach the end of their cups, they move on to their opponent\u2019s cups. When their counters are over, they pick the counters from the next cup and continue the game. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the next cup are captured by the player. The next player takes over.\\n\\nThe game continues until the last counter falls in a cup with two empty cups beyond it. The player can capture no more counters, and their turn is over.\\n\\nIn this intricate game, there are other rules that make it interesting. Although this game is best played between two players, even one person can play the game on a lazy afternoon. Pallankuzhi can be played by both children and adults.\\n\\n6. Antakshari\\n\\nAntakshari is one of the most popular traditional Indian games. The game is played widely in social gatherings and weddings. Children play it in their free time at school. The best thing about this game is that it can also be played in a small space, just like when traveling in a car.\\n\\nAntakshari is the best way to spend time. You need to have a repertoire of songs to play this game. You can play this game in a team. Each team sings in turns, starting from the last letter of the previous song sung by the other team.\\n\\n7. Moksha Patam\\n\\nMoksha Patam or Parama Padam is a board game that is believed to have been invented in ancient India and has spread to other parts of the world. Now, it is commonly called Snakes and Ladders. In ancient India, it was used as a form of entertainment and to teach morality to children.\\n\\nThe basic concept is to teach people that the way to reach heaven or \u201cmoksha\u201d is to abandon the bondage of passion. The ladder symbolizes the rise from one level of enlightenment to another, while the snake symbolizes immoral behavior and how they lead to degeneration. This game is played by two to four players. The first player to reach the \u201chighest heaven\u201d is the winner.\\n\\n8. Aadu puli aatam\\n\\nAadu puli aatam literally means \u201ca game of lambs and tigers.\u201d It is called meka puli aata in Telugu and aadu huli aata in Kannada. This is a two-player game where the tigers hunt goats on an asymmetric grid.\\n\\nIn this game, first, draw a triangle and divide it into three equal parts. Then, draw a rectangle on the entire triangle, intersecting it throughout. Then divide the rectangle horizontally into two parts. One player has 15 \u201cgoats,\u201d and the other player has three \u201ctigers.\u201d Each of these pieces is placed at the intersection point. Tigers try to eat goats, and goats try to actively stop them. The pieces are usually cowrie shells or pebbles.\\n\\n9. Chowkabara\\n\\nThis is another four-player game that is similar to Chaupar or Ludo. The goal of the game is to achieve home safety without getting removed by the opponents\u2019 pieces. The game is popular all over India and is known under different names, such as Eight and Four, Kattam Kalo, Chauka Baara, Changapoo, Ettu Veedu, Kattam Kazhi, and Aada Sada.\\n\\n10.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father.\\n\\nJekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde.

The Storybrooke events take place after \\\"The Other Shoe\\\".In the Characters' Past[edit]In Victorian England, Dr. Jekyll is joined by his friend Mary Lydgate, whose father, Dr. Lydgate, is a member of a prestigious science academy, as he hopes to convince him to back his project that he created, a serum that separates personalities, only to be rejected. The experiment would later attract the attention of Rumplestiltskin, who suddenly appears and helps Jekyll perfect the serum, and when Jekyll drinks it, he transforms into Hyde for the first time. That night at a party, Hyde, with the help of Rumplestiltskin, confronts Mary\u2019s father and threatens to expose the truth about him sleeping with his lab assistant if he doesn\u2019t grant Jekyll his membership into the academy. In the morning, Jekyll wakes up and remembers nothing but finds himself to be an academy member.Later on, Rumplestiltskin influences Jekyll to become Hyde again, this time to win over Mary, revealing that Jekyll has strong feelings for her, but she admits that she isn\u2019t interested in the same way and wants a man who wants to embrace passion without getting rid of it, and the two kiss.

He is soon visited by the Evil Queen and Hyde, who demanded a necklace. As Gold choked Hyde, he learned that he cannot be killed by The Evil Queen, although she tells Gold that their deal to protect Belle and the baby is still in effect. When news leaks of Hyde escaping the hospital, this suddenly disrupts the normally for David and Snow, as well as for Emma and Hook, who is ready to move in with her. When Regina and Jekyll shows off the necklace, they soon discover that the serum will be vital in defeating The Evil Queen and Hyde. With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering. Later on, Regina asks Gold for help, only to discover the Evil Queen and Hyde have already destroyed the lab but Jekyll managed to save a tiny bit of the serum which Regina wants to use on the Evil Queen.

When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to \\\"do what is necessary\\\" to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of \\\"weakness,\\\" but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that \u201cnecessity\u201d will make her love him once again.Back at Storybrooke Elementary School, Snow resumes her role as teacher, and introduces her new assistant Shirin to the class.

At the end of the school day, Shirin later meets up with the Oracle, where they are coordinating plans to search for Aladdin, as Shirin is revealed to be Princess Jasmine.Production[edit]- Rebecca Mader, who was credited in this episode, was not featured.- The episode features Jonny Coyne as Dr. Lydgate, reprising the role he originated in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, thus establishing Jekyll and Hyde's \\\"Victorian England\\\" as the same \\\"realm of story\\\" that was featured on that show.- The reason why Gold cuts his hair is because, during the break between the fifth and sixth seasons, Robert Carlyle had filmed Trainspotting 2 which required his hair to be shortened (Carlyle having worn a wig for the season's previous episodes).Reception[edit]Ratings[edit]The episode saw a drop from the previous outing, posting a 1.1/4 rating among 18-49s with 3.48 million tuning in.[1]Reviews[edit]- Justin Kirkland of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+.[2]- The AV Club gave out pointers on the episode, giving positive points on Jekyll and Hyde's backstory and twist, but were mixed on the premise and scenes.[3]- Christine Laskodi of TV Fantic gave the episode a good review: 4.0 out of 5.0[4]References[edit]- ^ \\\"TV Ratings Sunday: \u2018Simpsons\u2019 600th episode scores, \u2018Quantico\u2019 hits series low on mostly down night\\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (October 17, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time premiere recap: Strange Case'\\\" from Entertainment Weekly (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Jekyll and Hyde\u2019s \u201cStrange Case\u201d on Once Upon A Time melds good with evil\\\" from AV Club (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time Review: Strange Case\\\" from TV Fanatic (October 16, 2016)\",\"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case\",\"cleaned_text\": \"\\\"Strange Case\\\" is the fourth episode of the sixth season of the American fantasy drama series Once Upon a Time, which aired on October 16, 2016.

It consists of 10,000 queries sourced from multiple real-world and synthetically generated queries, specifically curated and repurposed for generative engines. The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty level, query intent, and other dimensions.UsageYou can easily load and use Geo-Bench in Python using the datasetslibrary:import datasets# Load Geo-Benchdataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"GEO-optim/geo-bench\")Data SourceGeo-Bench is a compilation of queries from various sources, both real and synthetically generated, to create a benchmark tailored for generative engines. The datasets used in constructing Geo-Bench are as follows:MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: These datasets contain real anonymized user queries from Bing and Google Search Engines, collectively representing common datasets used in search engine-related research.AIISouls: This dataset contains essay questions from \"All Souls College, Oxford University,\" challenging generative engines to perform reasoning and aggregate information from multiple sources.LIMA: Contains challenging questions requiring generative engines to not only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning to answer the question, such as writing short poems or generating Python code.Davinci-Debate: Contains debate questions generated for testing generative engines.Perplexity.ai Discover: These queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai's Discover section, an updated list of trending queries on the platform.EII-5: This dataset contains questions from the ELIS subreddit, where users ask complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman terms.GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query distribution, GPT-4 is prompted to generate queries ranging from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and difficulty levels (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).Apart from queries, we also provide 5 cleaned html responses based on top Google search results.TagsOptimizing website content often requires making targeted changes based on the domain of the task. Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature. To this end, we tag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For tagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall and precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated system, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered as the sole basis for filtering or analysis.Difficulty Level- The complexity of the query, ranging from simple to complex.- Example of a simple query: \"What is the capital of France?\"- Example of a complex query: \"What are the implications of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics?\"Nature of Query- The type of information sought by the query, such as factual, opinion, or comparison.- Example of a factual query: \"How does a car engine work?\"- Example of an opinion query: \"What is your opinion on the Harry Potter series?\"Genre- The category or domain of the query, such as arts and entertainment, finance, or science.- Example of a query in the arts and entertainment genre: \"Who won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020?\"- Example of a query in the finance genre: \"What is the current exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar?\"Specific Topics- The specific subject matter of the query, such as physics, economics, or computer science.- Example of a query on a specific topic in physics: \"What is the theory of relativity?\"- Example of a query on a specific topic in economics: \"What is the law of supply and demand?\"Sensitivity- Whether the query involves sensitive topics or not.- Example of a non-sensitive query: \"What is the tallest mountain in the world?\"- Example of a sensitive query: \"What is the current political situation in North Korea?\"User Intent- The purpose behind the user's query, such as research, purchase, or entertainment.- Example of a research intent query: \"What are the health benefits of a vegetarian diet?\"- Example of a purchase intent query: \"Where can I buy the latest iPhone?\"Answer Type- The format of the answer that the query is seeking, such as fact, opinion, or list.- Example of a fact answer type query: \"What is the population of New York City?\"- Example of an opinion answer type query: \"Is it better to buy or rent a house?\"Additional InformationGeo-Bench is intended for research purposes and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of content optimization for generative engines.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

          "summary": "Traditional games have always been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. There are a variety of indoor, outdoor and board games that were popular in Karnataka. Many of these interesting games were played by both the young and the old.\n\nBut with the advent of computers, mobile phones and play stations the concept of playing games have drastically changed in the state along with the rest of the country. Though a few of the traditional games are still played in Karnataka, people dwelling in the cities have lost touch with most of the traditional games.\n\nLet us take a look at some of the traditional games that were once enthusiastically played across Karnataka.\nChinni Dandu (Gilli Danda)\nGilli danda is one of the most popular outdoor games played all over India and even in South Asia. It is called Chinni Dandu in Kannada. This game is believed to be the origin of many European and American games such as Cricket, Baseball and Softball. The game is played with a peg (gilli) and a stick (danda), both of which are made of wood. The stick is used to strike the peg. It is a team game that requires hand eye co-ordination and concentration of the player.\n\nBuguri (Spinning the top)\nSpinning the top or Lattu is a fun game played across many parts of India and Pakistan. It is known as Buguri in Kannada. It is an interesting traditional game where a wooden top is made to spin. There are grooves in the lower half of the top and a nail at the bottom to spin on. A string is wrapped around the grooves to deploy the top and make it spin.\n\nGoti (Marbles)\nPopularly known as marbles, kancha or goli, it is a much loved gully sport in the country. It is called Goti in Kannada. This classic game requires the player to hit the selected target \u2018marble\u2019 using his/her own marble ball. The winner of the game walks away with all the marbles of the other players. This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.\n\nKabaddi\nKabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.\n\nKallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)\nKallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka. It requires the participants to lift round stone balls (called kallu gundu in Kannada) of various sizes and weights. The sport demands that the players be physically strong enough to lift heavy stones.\n\nPagade\nPagade is a cross and circle board game that is very similar to the ancient game of Pachisi or Chaupad. This game requires 2 or 4 players to race their respective pawns to reach the innermost square. The origin of the game can be traced to 4th century AD and it has remained popular throughout history.\n\nChowka Bara (Chakaara)\nChauka Bara is one of the oldest board games of India that is still played in some parts of the country. It is known as Chowka Bara in Mysuru and as Chakaara or Chakka in north Karnataka. This game is similar to ludo and can be played by 4 players. It is a game of chance that is played with cowry shells (called kavade in Kannada). The players attempt to race their pawns from the starting point to the safety of home. The game improves eye-to-eye coordination and teaches to make strategies.\n\nAshtapada\nAshtapada is an Indian board game that originated before chess. The game is played on a board having eight-by-eight grid of squares of same colour and the board has special markings known as \u201ccastles\u201d. Each player has an even number of game pieces and the objective is to move a game piece around the board in clockwise direction, enter the castle, and regain the castle back in a counter-clockwise direction so as to make the game piece reach the center. It can be played by 2 or 4 players.\n\nParamapada (Snakes & Ladders)\nSnakes & Ladders is a classic board game that originated in ancient India. It is known as Paramapada in Kannada. The game can be played by two or more players on a game-board that has numbered, gridded squares. The board has several ladders and snakes drawn on it. Players have to navigate their game piece from the start to the finish based on die rolls. The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.\n\nAli Guli Mane\nAli Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.\n\nLagori (Seven Stones)\nA stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.\n\nAdu Huli Aata (Tiger & Goat)\nTiger and goat is a hunt game that is known as Adu Huli Aata in Kannada. The game is played between 2 players where one player gets 3 tigers and the other player has 15 goats. The game is about the tigers trying to kill the goats while the goats look for ways to immobilize the tigers. This game requires planning and concentration on part of both the players.\n\nSaalu Mane Ata (Nine Men\u2019s Morris)\nNine Men\u2019s Morris is a traditional board game that originated in the western world. It is known as Saalu Mane Ata or Jodpi Ata or Char-Par in Kannada and is popular as Navakankari in various parts of India. This alignment game requires 2 players. Each player is given 9 coins and they try to achieve as many points as possible by getting 3 coins in a row on the game board. It is a complex game that requires strategic thinking.\n\nKunte Bille (Hopscotch)\nHopscotch is a traditional children\u2019s game that is known as Kunte Bille in Kannada. The game can be played alone or with several players. It involves drawing a court on the ground and then tossing a small object into the numbered rectangles of the court. The player then needs to hop or jump through the spaces in order to retrieve the object.\n\nKambala (Buffalo Race)\nKambala or Buffalo Race is a rural sport of Karnataka. This traditional sport involves farmers racing the buffaloes through tracks are ploughed into a muddy field that is made slushy with water. The sport is a source of much enjoyment for the rural folks of the state.\n\nHagga Jaggata (Tug of War)\nTug of war or rope pulling is an age-old sport that is known as Hagga Jaggata in Kannada. The sport involves two teams who pull on opposite ends of a rope in a test of strength. The objective is to pull the rope by both teams at opposite ends until one team drags the other over a central line.\n\nNaaku Kallu Aata (Four Stone)\nFour stone is an ancient traditional game that is known as Naaku Kallu Aata in Karnataka. It requires four independent boxes to be drawn on the ground. One player each stands in the four boxes and tries to take the four stones placed at the centre without being caught by the chaser in the game.\n\nHand Wrestling\nHand wrestling is enthusiastically played by the folks of",

Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across stateYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deityFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.Members of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.However, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.Status: BannedOld Mysuru regionCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu HaisoduKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.The ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara,The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.Status: PractisedHubbaliRam Fight of Savji CommunitySomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.At present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.Status: Banned, illegally practisedHubbaliKobri Hori competitionKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.The bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.Status: Banned, illegally practisedMangaluru, UdupiCock fighting or kori katteAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.A special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.The event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from `20,000-`25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,\u201d said activist Ravi.According to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.Status: Banned, illegally practisedNorth KarnatakaBullock cart racingBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years. The event which was widely held across the state is now restricted to parts of north Karnataka. The races are held during Dasara and Diwali.

Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.In the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals. The game has become an organised rural sport with committees setting up schedules and cash prizes.The game is conducted across Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and even parts of Kasaragod in Kerala. However, the sport has been put on hold due to an interim ban by the High Court, following opposition by animal rights activists.Previously, despite a petition for a ban on the event by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA), the races were held with regulations issued by local district administration.status: Interim ban",

Sadly, today\u2019s kids are so engrossed in playing video games that traditional games like Pallanguzi, Lippa, Kabaddi, Gilli-danda have been completely forgotten. Gone are the days when kids simply couldn\u2019t wait to go out and play a few rounds of Pithoo or Kith-Kith (Hopscotch) with their friends. The reduction in physical activity has given rise to a host of health issues in kids. Therefore, reviving traditional games will provide a host of health benefits. In this article, we will discuss both indoor and outdoor traditional Indian games. This will hopefully encourage little ones to play traditional games of India more often and keep traditions passing down from generation to generation.\n\nWhat Are Traditional Games?\nTraditional games are simply games which have been an important part of our culture for decades. These are often passed down from one generation to another.\n\nWhat Is The Importance Of Indian Traditional Games?\nIndian Traditional Games teach us a lot of essential day-to-day things like:\n- Help children learn how to count\n- Boosts memory and observation skills\n- Improves hand-eye coordination\n- Allows you to make meaningful choices\n- Fosters team spirit\n- Teaches strategy-building\n- Improves aim and focus\n- Improves body coordination\n\nIndian Traditional Indoor Games\nWe can play some games indoors whilst others are played outdoors. Both are equally enjoyed and can be played with a varying number of players. In this section, we will talk about some Indian traditional indoor games. Some of the traditional Indian indoor games are:\n\n1. Chaupar/Pachisi\nPachisi, a board game, was quite popular in ancient India. The game finds its mention in the Mahabharata. Akbar and his descendants also played this game. It involves two to four players who strategise their pawn\u2019s moves on a piece of cloth designed in the shape of a symmetrical cross to win the game.\nChaupar is also a board game which was invented around the 4th century. It includes two to four players who use cowry shells and wooden pawns to plan their manoeuvres and win the game. The contemporary version of Pachisi/Chaupar is Ludo which you might have played in your childhood.\n\n2. Pallankuzhi\nIt is one of the famous games which was played in ancient South India. Pallankuzhi is believed to have originated in Tamil Nadu and later spread to other places like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and even Malaysia and Sri Lanka. Variations of the game are called Kuzhipara in Malayalam, Ali Guli Mane in Kannada and Vamana Guntalu in Telugu. The game includes a rectangular board, divided into two horizontal rows and seven vertical columns. Thus, there are 14 cups on the board and 146 counters. Usually, cowry shells or tamarind seeds function as counters. Two people can play this game at a time.\n\n3. Gutte/Five Stones\nGutte is a fun game can be played by both adults and kids. It generally requires five pebbles or small stones. There is no limit on the number of players who can play this game at a given time.

          "summary": "Traditional folk sports in Karnataka remain on the horns of a dilemma\nTraditional sports and rituals involving animals are an integral part of many communities in rural parts of Karnataka. Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across state\n\nYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deity\nFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.\n\nMembers of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\n\n\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.\n\nHowever, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.\n\nStatus: Banned\nOld Mysuru region\nCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu Haisodu\nKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.\nThe ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.\n\nStatus: Practised\nHubbali\nRam Fight of Savji Community\nSomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.\n\nAt present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.\n\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nHubbali\nKobri Hori competition\nKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.\n\nThe bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.\n\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nMangaluru, Udupi\nCock fighting or kori katte\nAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.\n\nA special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.\n\nThe event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\n\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from 20,000-25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,\u201d said activist Ravi.\n\nAccording to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nNorth Karnataka\nBullock cart racing\nBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years. The event which was widely held across the state is now restricted to parts of north Karnataka. The races are held during Dasara and Diwali. Participants race in bullock carts and winners receive prize money.\n\nStatus: No ban\nUdupi\nBuffalo racing or kambala\nKambala is an annual buffalo race organised by agrarian families after the harvest of Rabi crop. Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.\n\nIn the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals. The game has become an organised rural sport with committees setting up schedules and cash prizes.\n\nThe game is conducted across Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and even parts of Kasaragod in Kerala. However, the sport has been put on hold due to an interim ban by the High Court, following opposition by animal rights activists.\n\nPreviously, despite a petition for a ban on the event by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA), the races were held with regulations issued by local district administration.\nStatus: Interim ban",

They help children improve their motor and social skills. Read this post to know about these and many other indoor and outdoor traditional Indian games.\\n\\nTraditional Indian Indoor Games\\nTraditional Indian indoor games usually require a lot of mental work and improve children\u2019s problem-solving skills. Some of these games have also been adopted by the Western world, and now we know them by their more popular English names.\\n\\n1. Pachisi/Chaupar\\n\\nPachisi or Chaupar is a well-known board game since it was the genesis of the Kurukshetra war in Mahabharata. The Mughals were fond of this game, too. Pachisi was traditionally played on a symmetrical cross cloth. On the other hand, Chaupar was a board game invented in the 4th century.\\n\\nIn both these games, two to four players use cowrie shells and dice to plan their maneuvers and attack opponents. Now, you call this game Ludo, one of the more popular games today. Pachisi or Chaupar is an excellent game to teach your child how to plan and execute.\\n\\n2. Anchankal/Kallankal\\n\\nThis game is widely played in Tamil Nadu. As the name of the game suggests, Anchankal is a game composed of five stones. The game improves hand-eye coordination, concentration, memory, and aiming abilities. This is a very engaging game, and the best part is that you can create your own steps.\\n\\nIn the original game, you use five smooth stones that can be held in your hand. Place the stones on the floor or any flat surface. Pick one stone, toss it in the air, and while that stone is in the air, pick another stone from the ground, while catching the stone tossed in the air before it hits the ground. Repeat this with the rest of the stones.\\n\\nYou can continue this game by picking up different numbers of stones from the floor, or even throwing a different number of stones into the air, and then picking up other stones before other stones fall. It is important that you should not let the stones tossed in the air fall on the ground. It requires some practice, but once you master it, you can enjoy hours of entertainment.\\n\\n3. Ashtapada\\n\\nAshtapada is the predecessor of chess. Just like a chessboard, the Ashtapada board is also divided into an 8\u00d78 square grids but of one color. Ashtapada is a dice game. There are markings on the corners and the center square of the board. These squares are called castles. The pieces on these squares are safe, captured, or removed by the opponents.\\n\\nEach player starts with an even number of pieces to play the game. The pieces must be moved clockwise around the board to enter the castle on the outer edge. Then they enter the castle in the center in a clockwise direction. This is a game to reach the castle.\\n\\nAnother variation of Ashtapada is Dasapada that is played on a 10\u00d710 board.\\n4. Chaturanga\\n\\nChaturanga is an ancient strategy game invented in India. It is believed to be the ancestor of strategy games, such as Chess, Xiangqi, Shogi, and Makruk. Chaturanga is mentioned in many ancient scripts. It is played on the Ashtapada board. There are two players.\\n\\nJust like modern chess, Chaturanga has various pieces \u2014 the King (Raja), General (Mantri or Senapati), Rook (Ratha), Elephant/Bishop (Gaja), Horse/Knight (Ashva), and Pawn (Padaati or Bhata). Each piece moves in a certain direction.\\n\\nThe ultimate goal is to get the opponent\u2019s king into trouble so that he cannot move without being taken by the enemy. Kings and generals played this game to gain new ideas about the form of war offensive.\\n\\n5. Pallankuzhi\\n\\nIt is believed that this ancient game originated in Tamil Nadu but later spread to other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Karnataka. This game gained popularity even in Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The game is still played in some rural parts of India and is called Kuzhipara, Ali Guli Mane, or Picchala Peeta in different languages.\\n\\nIn this game, we use a rectangular board that is divided into two rows and seven cups. Players must use 146 counters to put in these cups. These counters are usually cowrie shells or tamarind shells. Each cup contains 12 counters. In the middle row cups, only two counters are placed. There are two players taking turns.\\n\\nThe starting player picks the counters from any of the holes on their side and assigns a counter to each cup in a counterclockwise direction. Once they reach the end of their cups, they move on to their opponent\u2019s cups. When their counters are over, they pick the counters from the next cup and continue the game. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the next cup are captured by the player. The next player takes over.\\n\\nThe game continues until the last counter falls in a cup with two empty cups beyond it. The player can capture no more counters, and their turn is over.\\n\\nIn this intricate game, there are other rules that make it interesting. Although this game is best played between two players, even one person can play the game on a lazy afternoon. Pallankuzhi can be played by both children and adults.\\n\\n6. Antakshari\\n\\nAntakshari is one of the most popular traditional Indian games. The game is played widely in social gatherings and weddings. Children play it in their free time at school. The best thing about this game is that it can also be played in a small space, just like when traveling in a car.\\n\\nAntakshari is the best way to spend time. You need to have a repertoire of songs to play this game. You can play this game in a team. Each team sings in turns, starting from the last letter of the previous song sung by the other team.\\n\\n7. Moksha Patam\\n\\nMoksha Patam or Parama Padam is a board game that is believed to have been invented in ancient India and has spread to other parts of the world. Now, it is commonly called Snakes and Ladders. In ancient India, it was used as a form of entertainment and to teach morality to children.\\n\\nThe basic concept is to teach people that the way to reach heaven or \u201cmoksha\u201d is to abandon the bondage of passion. The ladder symbolizes the rise from one level of enlightenment to another, while the snake symbolizes immoral behavior and how they lead to degeneration. This game is played by two to four players. The first player to reach the \u201chighest heaven\u201d is the winner.\\n\\n8. Aadu puli aatam\\n\\nAadu puli aatam literally means \u201ca game of lambs and tigers.\u201d It is called meka puli aata in Telugu and aadu huli aata in Kannada. This is a two-player game where the tigers hunt goats on an asymmetric grid.\\n\\nIn this game, first, draw a triangle and divide it into three equal parts. Then, draw a rectangle on the entire triangle, intersecting it throughout. Then divide the rectangle horizontally into two parts. One player has 15 \u201cgoats,\u201d and the other player has three \u201ctigers.\u201d Each of these pieces is placed at the intersection point. Tigers try to eat goats, and goats try to actively stop them. The pieces are usually cowrie shells or pebbles.\\n\\n9. Chowkabara\\n\\nThis is another four-player game that is similar to Chaupar or Ludo. The goal of the game is to achieve home safety without getting removed by the opponents\u2019 pieces. The game is popular all over India and is known under different names, such as Eight and Four, Kattam Kalo, Chauka Baara, Changapoo, Ettu Veedu, Kattam Kazhi, and Aada Sada.\\n\\n10.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand.

Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

The Storybrooke events take place after \\\"The Other Shoe\\\".In the Characters' Past[edit]In Victorian England, Dr. Jekyll is joined by his friend Mary Lydgate, whose father, Dr. Lydgate, is a member of a prestigious science academy, as he hopes to convince him to back his project that he created, a serum that separates personalities, only to be rejected. The experiment would later attract the attention of Rumplestiltskin, who suddenly appears and helps Jekyll perfect the serum, and when Jekyll drinks it, he transforms into Hyde for the first time. That night at a party, Hyde, with the help of Rumplestiltskin, confronts Mary\u2019s father and threatens to expose the truth about him sleeping with his lab assistant if he doesn\u2019t grant Jekyll his membership into the academy. In the morning, Jekyll wakes up and remembers nothing but finds himself to be an academy member.Later on, Rumplestiltskin influences Jekyll to become Hyde again, this time to win over Mary, revealing that Jekyll has strong feelings for her, but she admits that she isn\u2019t interested in the same way and wants a man who wants to embrace passion without getting rid of it, and the two kiss. The following morning, Jekyll and Mary are waking up in bed together and are shocked by the outcome, as Jekyll tries to convince her that he is Hyde, but Mary is upset that Jekyll tricked her and tries to run away, prompting an angry Jekyll to push Mary out of the window and to her death. Realizing what he has done, Jekyll drinks the last of the serum and escapes as Hyde.In Storybrooke[edit]At the Pawn shop, Gold is looking in the mirror and sees his hair as he prepares to cut it, giving him a more crew cut appearance. He is soon visited by the Evil Queen and Hyde, who demanded a necklace. As Gold choked Hyde, he learned that he cannot be killed by The Evil Queen, although she tells Gold that their deal to protect Belle and the baby is still in effect. When news leaks of Hyde escaping the hospital, this suddenly disrupts the normally for David and Snow, as well as for Emma and Hook, who is ready to move in with her. When Regina and Jekyll shows off the necklace, they soon discover that the serum will be vital in defeating The Evil Queen and Hyde. With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering. Later on, Regina asks Gold for help, only to discover the Evil Queen and Hyde have already destroyed the lab but Jekyll managed to save a tiny bit of the serum which Regina wants to use on the Evil Queen. Gold to steals Jekyll\u2019s heart to convince Regina to hand over the serum which he then pours the serum onto his dagger which will be useful in killing Hyde. As Gold leaves, he tosses Jekyll\u2019s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.In the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, and this time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he switched serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One\u2019s dagger and uses it to control Gold to take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to \\\"do what is necessary\\\" to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of \\\"weakness,\\\" but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that \u201cnecessity\u201d will make her love him once again.Back at Storybrooke Elementary School, Snow resumes her role as teacher, and introduces her new assistant Shirin to the class. Realizing that the students are struggling, Shirin suggests that Snow embrace her past to inspire them. Taking a cue from Isaac Newton, Snow uses her experience as an archer and the students are in awe, winning her confidence with them. At the end of the school day, Shirin later meets up with the Oracle, where they are coordinating plans to search for Aladdin, as Shirin is revealed to be Princess Jasmine.Production[edit]- Rebecca Mader, who was credited in this episode, was not featured.- The episode features Jonny Coyne as Dr. Lydgate, reprising the role he originated in Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, thus establishing Jekyll and Hyde's \\\"Victorian England\\\" as the same \\\"realm of story\\\" that was featured on that show.- The reason why Gold cuts his hair is because, during the break between the fifth and sixth seasons, Robert Carlyle had filmed Trainspotting 2 which required his hair to be shortened (Carlyle having worn a wig for the season's previous episodes).Reception[edit]Ratings[edit]The episode saw a drop from the previous outing, posting a 1.1/4 rating among 18-49s with 3.48 million tuning in.[1]Reviews[edit]- Justin Kirkland of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+.[2]- The AV Club gave out pointers on the episode, giving positive points on Jekyll and Hyde's backstory and twist, but were mixed on the premise and scenes.[3]- Christine Laskodi of TV Fantic gave the episode a good review: 4.0 out of 5.0[4]References[edit]- ^ \\\"TV Ratings Sunday: \u2018Simpsons\u2019 600th episode scores, \u2018Quantico\u2019 hits series low on mostly down night\\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (October 17, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time premiere recap: Strange Case'\\\" from Entertainment Weekly (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Jekyll and Hyde\u2019s \u201cStrange Case\u201d on Once Upon A Time melds good with evil\\\" from AV Club (October 16, 2016)- ^ \\\"Once Upon a Time Review: Strange Case\\\" from TV Fanatic (October 16, 2016)\",\"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case\",\"cleaned_text\": \"\\\"Strange Case\\\" is the fourth episode of the sixth season of the American fantasy drama series Once Upon a Time, which aired on October 16, 2016. In this episode, the origins of Jekyll and Hyde with its ties to Rumplestiltskin are revealed, as Gold seeks vengeance to stop Hyde from threatening Belle, while Snow welcomes a new assistant who came from the Land of Untold Stories, who has an agenda of her own to deal with.\\n\\nIn Victorian England, Dr. Jekyll is joined by his friend Mary Lydgate, whose father, Dr. Lydgate, is a member of a prestigious science academy, as he hopes to convince him to back his project that he created, a serum that separates personalities, only to be rejected. The experiment would later attract the attention of Rumplestiltskin, who suddenly appears and helps Jekyll perfect the serum, and when Jekyll drinks it, he transforms into Hyde for the first time. That night at a party, Hyde, with the help of Rumplestiltskin, confronts Mary\u2019s father and threatens to expose the truth about him sleeping with his lab assistant if he doesn\u2019t grant Jekyll his membership into the academy. In the morning, Jekyll wakes up and remembers nothing but finds himself to be an academy member.\\n\\nLater on, Rumplestiltskin influences Jekyll to become Hyde again, this time to win over Mary, revealing that Jekyll has strong feelings for her, but she admits that she isn\u2019t interested in the same way and wants a man who wants to embrace passion without getting rid of it, and the two kiss. The following morning, Jekyll and Mary are waking up in bed together and are shocked by the outcome, as Jekyll tries to convince her that he is Hyde, but Mary is upset that Jekyll tricked her and tries to run away, prompting an angry Jekyll to push Mary out of the window and to her death. Realizing what he has done, Jekyll drinks the last of the serum and escapes as Hyde.\\n\\nAt the Pawn shop, Gold is looking in the mirror and sees his hair as he prepares to cut it, giving him a more crew cut appearance. He is soon visited by the Evil Queen and Hyde, who demanded a necklace. As Gold choked Hyde, he learned that he cannot be killed by The Evil Queen, although she tells Gold that their deal to protect Belle and the baby is still in effect. When news leaks of Hyde escaping the hospital, this suddenly disrupts the normally for David and Snow, as well as for Emma and Hook, who is ready to move in with her. When Regina and Jekyll shows off the necklace, they soon discover that the serum will be vital in defeating The Evil Queen and Hyde. With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering. Later on, Regina asks Gold for help, only to discover the Evil Queen and Hyde have already destroyed the lab but Jekyll managed to save a tiny bit of the serum which Regina wants to use on the Evil Queen. Gold to steals Jekyll\u2019s heart to convince Regina to hand over the serum which he then pours the serum onto his dagger which will be useful in killing Hyde. As Gold leaves, he tosses Jekyll\u2019s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.\\n\\nIn the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, and this time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he switched serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One\u2019s dagger and uses it to control Gold to take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to \\\"do what is necessary\\\" to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of \\\"weakness,\\\" but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that \u201cnecessity\u201d will make her love him once again.\\n\\nAt the end of the school day, Shirin later meets up with the Oracle, where they are coordinating plans to search for Aladdin, as Shirin is revealed to be Princess Jasmine.\"}] | 4 |who was the aztec ruler when the spanish arrived| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"history\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"historical\",\"research\",\"non-s(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Part of the (...TRUNCATED) | 1 |an open-source clone of unix created in the early 1990s| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"computers and electronics\",\"technical\",\"statement\",\"fact\",\"historical\",\"r(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"If you are a software developer in your 20s or 30s, you've grown up in a world dominat(...TRUNCATED) | 4 |when is an articulated lorry most likely to jackknife| [\"informational\",\"intermediate\",\"autos and vehicles\",\"technical\",\"question\",\"research\",\"fact\",\"non-s(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"This website uses cookies to improve your experience while you navigate through the we(...TRUNCATED) | 4 |how many mla and mp seats in telangana| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"law and government\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"research\",\"non-sen(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"2018 Telangana Legislative Assembly electionParts of this article (those related to so(...TRUNCATED) | 3 |does england have the right to bear arms| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"law and government\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"research\",\"non-sen(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"Passages of Arms: The English Bill of Rights and the American Second AmendmentSunday, (...TRUNCATED) | 1 |who won the champions league final in 2016| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"sports\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"historical\",\"research\",\"non-se(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"It was another epic encounter between these old rivals, featuring some of the best and(...TRUNCATED) | 4 |where do the hearts of palm come from| [\"informational\",\"simple\",\"food and drink\",\"non-technical\",\"question\",\"fact\",\"research\",\"non-sensiti(...TRUNCATED) | [{\"raw_text\":\"Most of us have tried, or at least heard of, a vegetable called the heart of palm.

It consists of 10,000 queries sourced from multiple real-world and synthetically generated queries, specifically curated and repurposed for generative engines. The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty level, query intent, and other dimensions.UsageYou can easily load and use Geo-Bench in Python using the datasetslibrary:import datasets# Load Geo-Benchdataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"GEO-optim/geo-bench\")Data SourceGeo-Bench is a compilation of queries from various sources, both real and synthetically generated, to create a benchmark tailored for generative engines. The datasets used in constructing Geo-Bench are as follows:MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: These datasets contain real anonymized user queries from Bing and Google Search Engines, collectively representing common datasets used in search engine-related research.AIISouls: This dataset contains essay questions from \"All Souls College, Oxford University,\" challenging generative engines to perform reasoning and aggregate information from multiple sources.LIMA: Contains challenging questions requiring generative engines to not only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning to answer the question, such as writing short poems or generating Python code.Davinci-Debate: Contains debate questions generated for testing generative engines.Perplexity.ai Discover: These queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai's Discover section, an updated list of trending queries on the platform.EII-5: This dataset contains questions from the ELIS subreddit, where users ask complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman terms.GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query distribution, GPT-4 is prompted to generate queries ranging from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and difficulty levels (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).Apart from queries, we also provide 5 cleaned html responses based on top Google search results.TagsOptimizing website content often requires making targeted changes based on the domain of the task. Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature. To this end, we tag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For tagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall and precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated system, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered as the sole basis for filtering or analysis.Difficulty Level- The complexity of the query, ranging from simple to complex.- Example of a simple query: \"What is the capital of France?\"- Example of a complex query: \"What are the implications of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in quantum mechanics?\"Nature of Query- The type of information sought by the query, such as factual, opinion, or comparison.- Example of a factual query: \"How does a car engine work?\"- Example of an opinion query: \"What is your opinion on the Harry Potter series?\"Genre- The category or domain of the query, such as arts and entertainment, finance, or science.- Example of a query in the arts and entertainment genre: \"Who won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020?\"- Example of a query in the finance genre: \"What is the current exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar?\"Specific Topics- The specific subject matter of the query, such as physics, economics, or computer science.- Example of a query on a specific topic in physics: \"What is the theory of relativity?\"- Example of a query on a specific topic in economics: \"What is the law of supply and demand?\"Sensitivity- Whether the query involves sensitive topics or not.- Example of a non-sensitive query: \"What is the tallest mountain in the world?\"- Example of a sensitive query: \"What is the current political situation in North Korea?\"User Intent- The purpose behind the user's query, such as research, purchase, or entertainment.- Example of a research intent query: \"What are the health benefits of a vegetarian diet?\"- Example of a purchase intent query: \"Where can I buy the latest iPhone?\"Answer Type- The format of the answer that the query is seeking, such as fact, opinion, or list.- Example of a fact answer type query: \"What is the population of New York City?\"- Example of an opinion answer type query: \"Is it better to buy or rent a house?\"Additional InformationGeo-Bench is intended for research purposes and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of content optimization for generative engines.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

          "summary": "Traditional games have always been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. There are a variety of indoor, outdoor and board games that were popular in Karnataka. Many of these interesting games were played by both the young and the old.\n\nBut with the advent of computers, mobile phones and play stations the concept of playing games have drastically changed in the state along with the rest of the country. Though a few of the traditional games are still played in Karnataka, people dwelling in the cities have lost touch with most of the traditional games.\n\nLet us take a look at some of the traditional games that were once enthusiastically played across Karnataka.\nChinni Dandu (Gilli Danda)\nGilli danda is one of the most popular outdoor games played all over India and even in South Asia. It is called Chinni Dandu in Kannada. This game is believed to be the origin of many European and American games such as Cricket, Baseball and Softball. The game is played with a peg (gilli) and a stick (danda), both of which are made of wood. The stick is used to strike the peg. It is a team game that requires hand eye co-ordination and concentration of the player.\n\nBuguri (Spinning the top)\nSpinning the top or Lattu is a fun game played across many parts of India and Pakistan. It is known as Buguri in Kannada. It is an interesting traditional game where a wooden top is made to spin. There are grooves in the lower half of the top and a nail at the bottom to spin on. A string is wrapped around the grooves to deploy the top and make it spin.\n\nGoti (Marbles)\nPopularly known as marbles, kancha or goli, it is a much loved gully sport in the country. It is called Goti in Kannada. This classic game requires the player to hit the selected target \u2018marble\u2019 using his/her own marble ball. The winner of the game walks away with all the marbles of the other players. This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.\n\nKabaddi\nKabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.\n\nKallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)\nKallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka. It requires the participants to lift round stone balls (called kallu gundu in Kannada) of various sizes and weights. The sport demands that the players be physically strong enough to lift heavy stones.\n\nPagade\nPagade is a cross and circle board game that is very similar to the ancient game of Pachisi or Chaupad. This game requires 2 or 4 players to race their respective pawns to reach the innermost square. The origin of the game can be traced to 4th century AD and it has remained popular throughout history.\n\nChowka Bara (Chakaara)\nChauka Bara is one of the oldest board games of India that is still played in some parts of the country. It is known as Chowka Bara in Mysuru and as Chakaara or Chakka in north Karnataka. This game is similar to ludo and can be played by 4 players. It is a game of chance that is played with cowry shells (called kavade in Kannada). The players attempt to race their pawns from the starting point to the safety of home. The game improves eye-to-eye coordination and teaches to make strategies.\n\nAshtapada\nAshtapada is an Indian board game that originated before chess. The game is played on a board having eight-by-eight grid of squares of same colour and the board has special markings known as \u201ccastles\u201d. Each player has an even number of game pieces and the objective is to move a game piece around the board in clockwise direction, enter the castle, and regain the castle back in a counter-clockwise direction so as to make the game piece reach the center. It can be played by 2 or 4 players.\n\nParamapada (Snakes & Ladders)\nSnakes & Ladders is a classic board game that originated in ancient India. It is known as Paramapada in Kannada. The game can be played by two or more players on a game-board that has numbered, gridded squares. The board has several ladders and snakes drawn on it. Players have to navigate their game piece from the start to the finish based on die rolls. The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.\n\nAli Guli Mane\nAli Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.\n\nLagori (Seven Stones)\nA stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.\n\nAdu Huli Aata (Tiger & Goat)\nTiger and goat is a hunt game that is known as Adu Huli Aata in Kannada. The game is played between 2 players where one player gets 3 tigers and the other player has 15 goats. The game is about the tigers trying to kill the goats while the goats look for ways to immobilize the tigers. This game requires planning and concentration on part of both the players.\n\nSaalu Mane Ata (Nine Men\u2019s Morris)\nNine Men\u2019s Morris is a traditional board game that originated in the western world. It is known as Saalu Mane Ata or Jodpi Ata or Char-Par in Kannada and is popular as Navakankari in various parts of India. This alignment game requires 2 players. Each player is given 9 coins and they try to achieve as many points as possible by getting 3 coins in a row on the game board. It is a complex game that requires strategic thinking.\n\nKunte Bille (Hopscotch)\nHopscotch is a traditional children\u2019s game that is known as Kunte Bille in Kannada. The game can be played alone or with several players. It involves drawing a court on the ground and then tossing a small object into the numbered rectangles of the court. The player then needs to hop or jump through the spaces in order to retrieve the object.\n\nKambala (Buffalo Race)\nKambala or Buffalo Race is a rural sport of Karnataka. This traditional sport involves farmers racing the buffaloes through tracks are ploughed into a muddy field that is made slushy with water. The sport is a source of much enjoyment for the rural folks of the state.\n\nHagga Jaggata (Tug of War)\nTug of war or rope pulling is an age-old sport that is known as Hagga Jaggata in Kannada. The sport involves two teams who pull on opposite ends of a rope in a test of strength. The objective is to pull the rope by both teams at opposite ends until one team drags the other over a central line.\n\nNaaku Kallu Aata (Four Stone)\nFour stone is an ancient traditional game that is known as Naaku Kallu Aata in Karnataka. It requires four independent boxes to be drawn on the ground. One player each stands in the four boxes and tries to take the four stones placed at the centre without being caught by the chaser in the game.\n\nHand Wrestling\nHand wrestling is enthusiastically played by the folks of",

            "raw_source": "Traditional sports and rituals involving animals are an integral part of many communities in rural parts of Karnataka. Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across stateYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deityFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.Members of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.However, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.Status: BannedOld Mysuru regionCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu HaisoduKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.The ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara,The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.Status: PractisedHubbaliRam Fight of Savji CommunitySomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.At present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.Status: Banned, illegally practisedHubbaliKobri Hori competitionKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.The bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.Status: Banned, illegally practisedMangaluru, UdupiCock fighting or kori katteAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.A special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.The event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from `20,000-`25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,\u201d said activist Ravi.According to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.Status: Banned, illegally practisedNorth KarnatakaBullock cart racingBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years. The event which was widely held across the state is now restricted to parts of north Karnataka. The races are held during Dasara and Diwali. Participants race in bullock carts and winners receive prize money.Status: No banUdupiBuffalo racing or kambalaKambala is an annual buffalo race organised by agrarian families after the harvest of Rabi crop. Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush.

            "raw_source": "Traditional games have always been a part of Karnataka\u2019s rich culture. There are a variety of indoor, outdoor and board games that were popular in Karnataka. Many of these interesting games were played by both the young and the old.But with the advent of computers, mobile phones and play stations the concept of playing games have drastically changed in the state along with the rest of the country.

This game requires aiming and concentration skills on part of the player.KabaddiKabbadi is a team sport that originated in ancient India. Two teams occupy opposite halves of an enclosure and each team sends in a raider to the other side in turns. The raider has to tackle members of the opposite team while chanting kabaddi during the raid before he returns to his side of the enclosure. It is a very popular sport that is played not only across India but also in countries like Bangladesh and Maldives.Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu (Stone Balls)Kallu Gundu Ettuvudu or Kallata is an outdoor sport of rural Karnataka.

The ladders help the game piece to progress while the snakes hinder their movement.Ali Guli ManeAli Guli Mane or Channe Mane is a traditional indoor board game of Karnataka. The game is generally played by two players on a wooden board that has 14 pits. The pits are used to store 70 tamarind seeds or cowry shells that act as counters in the game. It is an engaging game that helps to develop logic, hand-eye coordination and concentration.Lagori (Seven Stones)A stack of stones, a ball and a focused eye is all you need to play the game of lagori in an open courtyard. This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit.

It requires four independent boxes to be drawn on the ground. One player each stands in the four boxes and tries to take the four stones placed at the centre without being caught by the chaser in the game.Hand WrestlingHand wrestling is enthusiastically played by the folks of rural Karnataka.

          "summary": "Traditional folk sports in Karnataka remain on the horns of a dilemma\nTraditional sports and rituals involving animals are an integral part of many communities in rural parts of Karnataka. Today, many of these events are banned under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, but are widely practised. The protests over the ban on Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, followed by an ordinance allowing groups to conduct the event has led to demands for revoking the ban on such sports. Express takes a look at traditional sporting events held across state\n\nYadgir - Tossing lambs over palanquin of village deity\nFor over a century, villagers in Mailapur in Yadgir taluk have performed the ritual of tossing lambs over the palanquin of the village deity Mallaiah. This is practised during the annual fair of Mailapur Mallaiah on the day of Sankranti (January 14) every year.\n\nMembers of the Kuruba community sacrifice the lamb as a gesture of devotion to the deity. Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\n\n\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.\n\nHowever, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice. This year, six devotees tossed sheep over the palanquin. Police later arrested three people.\n\nStatus: Banned\nOld Mysuru region\nCattle made to jump across fire or Kichchu Haisodu\nKichchu Haisodu is a ritual associated with farming in old Mysuru region.\nThe ritual is observed during Makara Sankranti every year when cattle are made to jump over fire. The cattle - bull and cow - are bathed, their horns painted and decorated. Later in the evening, they are made to jump over the fire. The ritual is still practised in villages around Bengaluru, Mandya, Ramanagara, Mysuru and Hassan. Farmers believe that the practice of making cattle jump over fire will kill small insects present on their body.\n\nStatus: Practised\nHubbali\nRam Fight of Savji Community\nSomavansha Sahasrajun Kshatriya Samaj members also known as Savji community hold ram fights during Dasara. The community has been practising this for hundreds of years. Earlier, such fights were organised in district stadiums. But as crowds swelled, it attracted animal rights activists who vehemently opposed it.\n\nAt present, it is only held in areas where members of the Savji community live, mostly in Dajibanpet and Kamaripet in Hubballi. Organisers say the sport is part of their culture and courts should respect the sentiments of the people. Many Muslim families in Hubballi too organise ram fights annually.\n\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nHubbali\nKobri Hori competition\nKobri Hori Sparde translated as catch a running bull is among the state\u2019s most popular rural sport. The event is held during Diwali when farmers, agricultural workers and youngsters try to subdue a bull and then tie dry coconuts around its horns.\n\nThe bulls are then taken in a procession around the village or town. Farmers usually sharpen the animal\u2019s horn before the event. Over the years, stories of competitors losing their lives or suffering injuries has marred the event.\n\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nMangaluru, Udupi\nCock fighting or kori katte\nAlthough a banned sport, cock fighting still thrives illegally in parts of Karnataka. However, the scale of the event pales in comparison with Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana where it is a huge betting sport, running to crores. Dakshin Kannada and Udupi districts still follow this age old tradition.\n\nA special breed of cocks/fowls which are known as game cocks are bred and trained for fighting purposes. Blades are tied to the roosters spurs. Farmers engage in this activity before and after harvesting paddy crops.\n\nThe event is held after festivals like Sankranti and Diwali and is organised a few times a year in the vicinity of temples around Mangaluru and Udupi.\n\u201cThe sport is held secretively as it is banned by High Courts and the Supreme Court. The cost of roosters varies from 20,000-25,000 while the betting may go up to a few lakhs,\u201d said activist Ravi.\n\nAccording to PeTA India, cock fighting community rear, the roosters and trains them in such a way that these birds become killers.\nStatus: Banned, illegally practised\nNorth Karnataka\nBullock cart racing\nBullock cart racing has been a traditional sport practised for more than hundred years. The event which was widely held across the state is now restricted to parts of north Karnataka. The races are held during Dasara and Diwali. Participants race in bullock carts and winners receive prize money.\n\nStatus: No ban\nUdupi\nBuffalo racing or kambala\nKambala is an annual buffalo race organised by agrarian families after the harvest of Rabi crop. Kambala season lasts from November to March, before the onset of summer when Kolke crop is cultivated. The animals race in paddy fields filled with slush. Locals believe this practice prepares the land for the Kolke crop.\n\nIn the last 50 years, Kambala\u2019s mandate has changed and the folk sport has turned into a money spinner with audiences placing huge bets on the animals. The game has become an organised rural sport with committees setting up schedules and cash prizes.\n\nThe game is conducted across Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and even parts of Kasaragod in Kerala. However, the sport has been put on hold due to an interim ban by the High Court, following opposition by animal rights activists.\n\nPreviously, despite a petition for a ban on the event by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA), the races were held with regulations issued by local district administration.\nStatus: Interim ban",

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.Dr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.HistoryDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Jekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories. (\\\"Strange Case\\\")Still in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde. (\\\"Only You\\\")Jekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner. (\\\"Only You\\\", \\\"An Untold Story\\\")When the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde. (\\\"The Savior\\\")At the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with. (\\\"The Other Shoe\\\")Jekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece of the shell before running onto the deck and attempting to exit the ship, but she cannot since Mr. Gold's protection spell is still intact. Jekyll corners her and explains he wants to kill her as revenge on the Dark One, whom he blames for Mary's death. Hook comes out of hiding to defend Belle, and after a scuffle, he shoves Jekyll away, causing the man to be punctured through the chest by a harpoon. With Jekyll dead, Hyde succumbs soon after as well, proving to Mr. Gold and Regina that the only way a split half of a person can be killed is if the original dies.

He d\u00e9buts in the twenty-second episode of the fifth season and is portrayed by guest star Hank Harris.\\n\\nDr. Jekyll is based on the character of the same name from Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Mary Reilly.\\nHistory\\nDr. Jekyll, an aspiring scientist in Victorian England, creates a serum that can give a man control over his darker tendencies. To this end, he asks Dr. Lydgate to come to his lab in hopes of being accepted into the academy and getting the supplies he needs. Lydgate's daughter, Mary, for whom Jekyll holds unreciprocated affection, helps him prepare for the visit, where Jekyll presents the idea for the serum to Dr. Lydgate. However, when Lydgate realizes Jekyll's intention of becoming a member of the academy, he tells the doctor that his work is too dangerous. A disappointed Jekyll is momentarily comforted by Mary before she leaves with her father.\\n\\nJekyll is later visited by Rumplestiltskin, who uses magic to finish the serum for him. Insisting that the darkness within Jekyll is actually power, not something to be afraid of, Rumplestiltskin suggests that Jekyll uses it to get what he wants: Mary. Jekyll downs the serum, painfully transforming into an entirely different person, who arrives at a party Dr. Lydgate and Mary are attending. Seeing himself in the mirror, Jekyll's new form remarks that he does not feel or even look like Jekyll, to which Rumplestiltskin explains that he is not. He is merely a part of Jekyll that Jekyll wished to hide, which gives Rumplestiltskin an idea for a name for the man: Mr. Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later awakens, but has no memory of what happened after he transformed. Rumplestiltskin suggests that he look in his pocket, and Jekyll finds an academy pendant, meaning he was finally accepted, thanks to Mr. Hyde. However, Rumplestiltskin points out that Jekyll did not get Mary, so Jekyll downs the serum again. This time, when he awakens, he is in bed with Mary, who is shocked to see him. Jekyll realizes that Mary fell in love with Hyde, and becomes angry when she says she could never love Jekyll, to which he accidentally shoves her out the window. Fearful of being caught, he takes the serum once more, leaving Hyde as the only possible culprit. Rumplestiltskin later deems Hyde a failed experiment because of his love for Mary, and forces him, and therefore Jekyll, into the Land of Untold Stories.\\n\\nStill in the Land of Untold Stories, Mr. Hyde assigns an orderly named Poole to keep watch on his other half. Without either Hyde or Poole knowing, Jekyll begins growing a purple flower that will serve as the final ingredient in a serum meant to permanently separate himself and Hyde into two different bodies. While he is in the midst of collecting one of the flowers, a group of strangers come to him. David, Hook, Snow and Zelena ask him for magic to repair a broken wand they need for returning home, but Jekyll declines to help them, in fear of punishment from Hyde, and tries to make them leave. Instead, Poole shows up to magically taser the strangers into unconsciousness. After the group have met Hyde, Jekyll regains control again and visits the prisoners. He agrees to repair the wand in the hospital lab if they will take him with them when they return home. In the lab, he succeeds in fixing the wand, but when Poole catches him, he lies about the warden ordering him to repair the wand. Despite the latter's protest that Hyde doesn't like to be disturbed, he forces Jekyll to drink the serum to wake up Hyde.\\n\\nJekyll later wakes up in a straitjacket, and while Poole is asleep, he frees himself and grabs the cell key to free the prisoners. Jekyll takes his new allies to his old home, where he uses the purple flower to complete a red serum to defeat the warden, without telling the group that he and Hyde actually share the same body. Before he can, Poole once again makes him drink the blue serum, making Hyde come out. After the group escapes, Hyde takes the red serum, with him and Jekyll gaining separate bodies. Hyde, at first, seems pleased to meet Jekyll and even helps him up from the floor, but he then deems him to be disappointing and pathetic. When Hyde tries to choke the life out of Jekyll, Hook knocks him unconscious. Before leaving the house, Jekyll grabs the last remains of the red serum. He and his allies escape into the city, where they are eventually cornered by Hyde. The confrontation comes to a halt when pennies start raining down from the sky and a watery portal opens up. Everyone except Hyde manages to jump in and land back into the Land Without Magic. The night before returning to Storybrooke, Jekyll thanks the heroes for saving him by giving them the red serum, which Regina uses to kill a part of herself. On arrival to Storybrooke, David brings Jekyll to the diner.\\n\\nWhen the dirigible carrying Hyde's \\\"friends\\\" comes into town, Jekyll is among the many towns people who witness its arrival. After Regina and Emma unsuccessfully try to take down Hyde, he examines the remains of the blimp with the group, long after the passengers on it have fled. Snow wonders what Hyde wants with the people, and Jekyll suggests it might depend on who Hyde brought with him, and the stories that play out could create chaos. Jekyll offers to use the remains to construct a weapon similar to the Orderly's baton to beat Hyde, as the dirigible and the baton were made from the same materials. In addition to this, Jekyll also creates a pair of cuffs from scraps of dirigible. Later, as part of a ruse to lure Hyde out, Regina shows up outside the mayor's office with Jekyll, offering him in exchange for Hyde leaving town, although Hyde instead offers to kill Regina unless she hands him over. After Regina throws a fire ball at him, Hyde strangles Regina until Emma blasts him with the baton. Hyde is thrown back onto the windshield and becomes temporarily stunned, allowing Jekyll to clamp the cuffs on him before David and Hook apprehend Hyde.\\n\\nAt the site of the dirigible, Jekyll tries to recreate the serum that separated Regina and the Queen, in order to figure out why the Queen is still alive despite having her heart crushed by Regina. He fails in the experiment because the equipment is not as advanced as what he had in the Land of Untold Stories, however, Regina and Snow bring him to Dr. Whale, who has the necessary lab gear for him to work with.\\n\\nJekyll continues to work on the serum in Dr. Whale's garage, but for it to be complete, he needs Mr. Gold's magic for the finishing touch. He discovers Hyde is on the loose again after receiving Mary's necklace from him, and in fear his other half will somehow destroy the serum, he puts a small portion of it in a separate vial. While Regina leaves to get Mr. Gold, Doc and Leroy are left with the doctor in the lab. Jekyll asks Leroy to fetch him a mutton sandwich with extra pickles from Granny's, which the dwarf does grudgingly. Hyde tracks down Jekyll, having found him because the Queen put a beckoning spell on Mary's necklace, and he obliterates the serum. Without Jekyll knowing, Hyde also switches out the remaining serum vial with a decoy. Mr. Gold has his own plans to use the serum to kill Hyde and rips out Jekyll's heart to keep Regina from interfering. After dousing the serum on the Dark One's dagger, he tosses the heart back to Regina and leaves. Jekyll heads onto the Jolly Roger, where he meets Mr. Gold's wife Belle, and alludes to the unresolved anger he has over Mary choosing Hyde instead of him. While Belle grows uneasy with him, she reaches for a conch shell to call for Hook, but Jekyll breaks it. Belle stabs him with a piece.\\n\\n\"},{\"raw_text\": \"On the Season 6 premiere episode of Once Upon a Time, \u2018The Savior,\u2019 while refugees from the Land of Untold Stories invade Storybrooke and in a flashback Jafar (Oded Fehr) confronts Aladdin (Deniz Akdeniz), Emma (Jennifer Morrison) and the heroes try to stop Mr. Hyde which won\u2019t be easy.

The Storybrooke events take place after \\\"The Other Shoe\\\".In the Characters' Past[edit]In Victorian England, Dr. Jekyll is joined by his friend Mary Lydgate, whose father, Dr. Lydgate, is a member of a prestigious science academy, as he hopes to convince him to back his project that he created, a serum that separates personalities, only to be rejected. The experiment would later attract the attention of Rumplestiltskin, who suddenly appears and helps Jekyll perfect the serum, and when Jekyll drinks it, he transforms into Hyde for the first time. That night at a party, Hyde, with the help of Rumplestiltskin, confronts Mary\u2019s father and threatens to expose the truth about him sleeping with his lab assistant if he doesn\u2019t grant Jekyll his membership into the academy. In the morning, Jekyll wakes up and remembers nothing but finds himself to be an academy member.Later on, Rumplestiltskin influences Jekyll to become Hyde again, this time to win over Mary, revealing that Jekyll has strong feelings for her, but she admits that she isn\u2019t interested in the same way and wants a man who wants to embrace passion without getting rid of it, and the two kiss.

He is soon visited by the Evil Queen and Hyde, who demanded a necklace. As Gold choked Hyde, he learned that he cannot be killed by The Evil Queen, although she tells Gold that their deal to protect Belle and the baby is still in effect. When news leaks of Hyde escaping the hospital, this suddenly disrupts the normally for David and Snow, as well as for Emma and Hook, who is ready to move in with her. When Regina and Jekyll shows off the necklace, they soon discover that the serum will be vital in defeating The Evil Queen and Hyde. With Hook having moved out of the Jolly Roger, he gave Belle a magical seashell to use as an emergency, but Gold later stopped by to ask Belle to offer her protection. After Belle refused, Gold placed a protection spell on the ship in order to prevent Belle from leaving and keep Hyde from entering. Later on, Regina asks Gold for help, only to discover the Evil Queen and Hyde have already destroyed the lab but Jekyll managed to save a tiny bit of the serum which Regina wants to use on the Evil Queen. Gold to steals Jekyll\u2019s heart to convince Regina to hand over the serum which he then pours the serum onto his dagger which will be useful in killing Hyde. As Gold leaves, he tosses Jekyll\u2019s heart back to Regina, who then sends him to the Jolly Roger to stay with Belle.In the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, and this time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold come out of nowhere and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he switched serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One\u2019s dagger and uses it to control Gold to take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to \\\"do what is necessary\\\" to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of \\\"weakness,\\\" but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that \u201cnecessity\u201d will make her love him once again.Back at Storybrooke Elementary School, Snow resumes her role as teacher, and introduces her new assistant Shirin to the class.

It consists of 10,000 queries sourced from multiple real-world and synthetically generated queries, specifically curated and repurposed for generative engines. The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty level, query intent, and other dimensions.UsageYou can easily load and use Geo-Bench in Python using the datasetslibrary:import datasets# Load Geo-Benchdataset = datasets.load_dataset(\"GEO-optim/geo-bench\")Data SourceGeo-Bench is a compilation of queries from various sources, both real and synthetically generated, to create a benchmark tailored for generative engines. The datasets used in constructing Geo-Bench are as follows:MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: These datasets contain real anonymized user queries from Bing and Google Search Engines, collectively representing common datasets used in search engine-related research.AIISouls: This dataset contains essay questions from \"All Souls College, Oxford University,\" challenging generative engines to perform reasoning and aggregate information from multiple sources.LIMA: Contains challenging questions requiring generative engines to not only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning to answer the question, such as writing short poems or generating Python code.Davinci-Debate: Contains debate questions generated for testing generative engines.Perplexity.ai Discover: These queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai's Discover section, an updated list of trending queries on the platform.EII-5: This dataset contains questions from the ELIS subreddit, where users ask complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman terms.GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query distribution, GPT-4 is prompted to generate queries ranging from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and difficulty levels (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).Apart from queries, we also provide 5 cleaned html responses based on top Google search results.TagsOptimizing website content often requires making targeted changes based on the domain of the task. Further, a user of GENERATIVE ENGINE OPTIMIZATION may need to find an appropriate method for only a subset of queries based on multiple factors, such as domain, user intent, query nature.

This emerging technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them using LLMs. While this shift significantly improvesuser utility and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for the third stakeholder -- website and content creators. Given the black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content creators have little to no control over when and how their content is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench, a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost visibility by up to 40\\% in generative engine responses. Moreover, we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with profound implications for both developers of generative engines and content creators.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},pages = {5\u201316},numpages = {12},keywords = {datasets and benchmarks, generative models, search engines},location = {Barcelona, Spain},series = {KDD '24}}- Downloads last month- 771",

This game is quite popular in the North and Eastern states of India and is fondly called pittu, lingochi or palli patti by many. However, it is becoming increasingly popular in Mangalore and a common outdoor norm amongst the youth. The game involves a pile of flat stones and two opposing teams. A player from one team throws the ball at the pile to disrupt it, and runs. The players of the opposite team reach for the ball and run to hit the players of the ball-throwing team who re-make the stack in the meantime without getting hit. It barely makes use of any expensive tools or equipment and is really easy to follow. No wonder it has been gaining heat lately.\n\nAdu Huli Aata (Tiger & Goat)\nTiger and goat is a hunt game that is known as Adu Huli Aata in Kannada.

Apart from Kurubas, members of Gonda community also participate in the ritual. Keshava Motagi, president of Nandi Animal Welfare Society, Kalaburagi, said the tradition is mere fashion today and is cruelty to animals.\u201cIn this modern era, such practices should be prohibited,\u201d Motagi said. Thousands of devotees arrive from parts of Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra to take part in the fair. The ritual has been banned for the past three years by the Yadgir district administration.However, despite the ban, some devotees have continued the practice.

Sadly, today\u2019s kids are so engrossed in playing video games that traditional games like Pallanguzi, Lippa, Kabaddi, Gilli-danda have been completely forgotten. Gone are the days when kids simply couldn\u2019t wait to go out and play a few rounds of Pithoo or Kith-Kith (Hopscotch) with their friends. The reduction in physical activity has given rise to a host of health issues in kids. Therefore, reviving traditional games will provide a host of health benefits. In this article, we will discuss both indoor and outdoor traditional Indian games. This will hopefully encourage little ones to play traditional games of India more often and keep traditions passing down from generation to generation.\n\nWhat Are Traditional Games?\nTraditional games are simply games which have been an important part of our culture for decades. These are often passed down from one generation to another.\n\nWhat Is The Importance Of Indian Traditional Games?\nIndian Traditional Games teach us a lot of essential day-to-day things like:\n- Help children learn how to count\n- Boosts memory and observation skills\n- Improves hand-eye coordination\n- Allows you to make meaningful choices\n- Fosters team spirit\n- Teaches strategy-building\n- Improves aim and focus\n- Improves body coordination\n\nIndian Traditional Indoor Games\nWe can play some games indoors whilst others are played outdoors. Both are equally enjoyed and can be played with a varying number of players. In this section, we will talk about some Indian traditional indoor games. Some of the traditional Indian indoor games are:\n\n1. Chaupar/Pachisi\nPachisi, a board game, was quite popular in ancient India. The game finds its mention in the Mahabharata. Akbar and his descendants also played this game. It involves two to four players who strategise their pawn\u2019s moves on a piece of cloth designed in the shape of a symmetrical cross to win the game.\nChaupar is also a board game which was invented around the 4th century. It includes two to four players who use cowry shells and wooden pawns to plan their manoeuvres and win the game. The contemporary version of Pachisi/Chaupar is Ludo which you might have played in your childhood.\n\n2. Pallankuzhi\nIt is one of the famous games which was played in ancient South India. Pallankuzhi is believed to have originated in Tamil Nadu and later spread to other places like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and even Malaysia and Sri Lanka. Variations of the game are called Kuzhipara in Malayalam, Ali Guli Mane in Kannada and Vamana Guntalu in Telugu. The game includes a rectangular board, divided into two horizontal rows and seven vertical columns. Thus, there are 14 cups on the board and 146 counters. Usually, cowry shells or tamarind seeds function as counters. Two people can play this game at a time.\n\n3. Gutte/Five Stones\nGutte is a fun game can be played by both adults and kids. It generally requires five pebbles or small stones. There is no limit on the number of players who can play this game at a given time. The player needs to spin a stone up in the air and gather the remaining stones lying on the floor with one hand without allowing the one in the air to fall to the ground. Next, the player has to throw two stones up in the air and collect the rest and so on. The player who finishes eight steps in the minimum number of tries is the winner.\n\n4. Lattoo\nSpinning top or Lattoo is a popular game in Indian villages even today. This simple game has been in existence since 3500 BC. At the beginning, tops were made of clay. Later, wooden tops began to be used. Today, coloured and designer tops are also available. There is a string which helps to spin the top and also to lift up the spinning Lattoo. Two or more players can play this game. All the players wrap their tops with the string and then unwind it by pulling the string, making the top rotate on the ground. The players need to pick the top with the string as fast as they can. The player whose top spins the longest is declared the winner.\n\n5. Antakshari\nAntakshari is an entertaining Indian desi game is often played by grown-ups and children alike. It originated in Indian and is now played worldwide with alterations. Variations can be made to the original idea to suit the occasion such as family gathering, weddings, parties, etc. To play this game, two teams are made. One team sings a song, typically a Bollywood song. The other team has to sing a song beginning with the last consonant of the song sung by the first team. Both the teams keep taking turns until one can\u2019t think of a song and thus loses.\n\n6. Kalaney Belaney\nThe name of the game means \u201cblack elephant, white elephant\u201d.

Ashtapada\nThis game is a predecessor of the game of Chess. Like chess, the Ashtapada board is also divided into an 8\u00d78 square grid but they are all of the same colours. It is a dice game. There are markings on the corners and on the centre square of the board. These squares are called castles. The pieces on these squares are either safe, captured, or removed by opponents.\nEach player starts with an even number of pieces. The pieces move clockwise around the board to enter the castle on the outer edge. Then they enter the castle in the centre in a clockwise direction. The ultimate goal is to reach the castle. Dasapada is another variation that is played on a 10\u00d710 board.\n\n8. Chaturanga\nChaturanga is an ancient strategy game which was invented in India.

The ultimate goal is to corner the opponent\u2019s king such that the king will be killed by your pieces.\n\n9. Moksha Patam\nMoksha Patam is a board game that is believed to have been invented in ancient India and subsequently spread to the rest of the world. Nowadays, it is commonly called Snakes and Ladders. The basic concept is to teach people that the way to reach heaven or \u201cmoksha\u201d us to leave behind the bondage of passion.

This is a two-player game where the tigers hunt the goats on an asymmetric grid.\nTo set the board, first, draw a triangle and divide it into three equal parts. Then, draw a rectangle on the entire triangle, intersecting it throughout. Then divide the rectangle horizontally into two parts. One player has 15 \u201cgoats,\u201d and the other player has three \u201ctigers.\u201d Each of these pieces is placed at the intersection. The tigers try to eat the goats, and the goats try to stop them actively. The pieces are usually cowrie shells or pebbles.\n\n11. Pancha Kone\nThis is a popular Indian traditional game.
